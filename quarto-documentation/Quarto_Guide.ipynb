    "Now, the notebook is ready for writing content. Quarto supports all the functionality of a standard ipynb file â€“ code cells, markdown, and LaTeX. To begin writing lecture notes, it's a good idea to first set out the main headings of the document. These typically correspond to the title slides of each lecture ([example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FZJhOS8S1lCqZCRxbyys9rCZT0QxdY4hcmvZDskEHFI/edit#slide=id.g1150ea2fb2b_0_220)) and are written with the Markdown second headng level (`##`). Quarto will auto-populate the table of contents as these headings are created.\n",
