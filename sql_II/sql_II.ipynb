This means that SQL queries sometimes don't follow what a reader sees as a \"logical\" sequence of thought. Instead, SQL requires that we follow its set order of operations when constructing queries.

        "\n",
        "When working with `pandas`, we often ran into situations where we wanted to generate new columns using some form of conditional statement. For example, say we wanted to describe a film title as \"old,\" \"mid-aged,\" or \"new,\" depending on the year of its release.\n",
        "\n",
        "In SQL, conditional operations are performed using a `CASE` clause. Conceptually, `CASE` behaves much like the `CAST` operation: it creates a new column that we can then `SELECT` to appear in the output. The syntax for a `CASE` clause is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "    CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <value>\n",
        "         WHEN <other condition> THEN <other value>\n",

        "         ELSE <yet another value>\n",
        "         END\n",
        "\n",
        "Scanning through the skeleton code above, you can see that the logic is similar to that of an `if` statement in Python. The conditional statement is first opened by calling `CASE`. Each new condition is specified by `WHEN`, with `THEN` indicating what value should be filled if the condition is met. `ELSE` specifies the value that should be filled if no other conditions are met. Lastly, `END` indicates the end of the conditional statement; once `END` has been called, SQL will continue evaluating the query as usual. \n",

What happens if the data we need is distributed across multiple tables? This is an important consideration when using SQL —— recall that we first introduced SQL as a language to query from databases. Databases often store data in a multidimensional structure. In other words, information is stored across several tables, with each table containing a small subset of all the data housed by the database. \n",
