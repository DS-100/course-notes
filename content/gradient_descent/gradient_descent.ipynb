    "Let’s redefine **p as the number of columns in our covariate matrix** and **add a column of 1s** to encode the intercept (if desired). If we choose to add a column of 1s, then $x_1$ can be a 1 for every data point.\n",

    "#### Uniqueness of a Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In most settings, the number of observations ($n$) is much greater than the number of features ($p$). Note that at least one solution always exists because intuitively, we can always draw a line of best fit for a given set of data, but there may be multiple lines that are “equally good”. (Formal proof is beyond this course.) Let's now revisit the interpretation for uniqueness of a solution at the end of the last lecture, but with the new notation of $p$ instead of $p+1$ features.\n",

    "* We know the solution to the normal equation $\\mathbb{X}^T\\mathbb{X}\\hat{\\theta} = \\mathbb{X}^T\\mathbb{Y}$ is the least square estimate that minimizes the squared loss.\n",
    "* $\\hat{\\theta}$ has a **unique** solution $\\iff$ the square matrix $\\mathbb{X}^T\\mathbb{X}$ is **invertible** $\\iff$ $\\mathbb{X}^T\\mathbb{X}$ is full rank.\n",
    "  * The **column rank** of a square matrix is the max number of linearly independent columns it contains.\n",
    "  * An $n$ x $n$ square matrix is deemed full column rank when all of its columns are linearly independent. That is, its rank would be equal to $n$.\n",
    "  * $\\mathbb{X}^T\\mathbb{X}$ has shape $p \\times p$, and therefore has max rank $p$. \n",
    "* $rank(\\mathbb{X}^T\\mathbb{X})$ = $rank(\\mathbb{X})$ (proof out of scope).\n",
    "* Therefore, $\\mathbb{X}^T\\mathbb{X}$ has rank $p$ $\\iff$  $\\mathbb{X}$ has rank $p$ $\\iff \\mathbb{X}$ is full column rank.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if $\\mathbb{X}$ is not full column rank, we will not have unique estimates. This can happen for two major reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If our design matrix $\\mathbb{X}$ is \"**wide**\":\n",
    "    * If n < p, then we have way more features (columns) than observations (rows).\n",
    "    * Then $rank(\\mathbb{X})$ = min(n, p) < p, so $\\hat{\\theta}$ is not unique.\n",
    "    * Typically we have n >> p so this is less of an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If our design matrix $\\mathbb{X}$ has features that are **linear combinations** of other features:\n",
    "    * By definition, rank of $\\mathbb{X}$ is number of linearly independent columns in $\\mathbb{X}$.\n",
    "    * Example: If “Width”, “Height”, and “Perimeter” are all columns,\n",
    "      * Perimeter = 2 * Width + 2 * Height  $\\rightarrow$  $\\mathbb{X}$ is not full rank.\n",
    "    * Important with one-hot encoding (to discuss later).\n",

    "To make life *even easier*, we can turn to the `sklearn` `python` [library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). `sklearn` is a robust library of machine learning tools used extensively in research and industry. It is the standard for simple machine learning tasks and gives us a wide variety of in-built modeling frameworks and methods, so we'll keep returning to `sklearn` techniques as we progress through Data 100. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the specific type of model being implemented, `sklearn` follows a standard set of steps for creating a model: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the `LinearRegression` model from `sklearn`\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a model object. This generates a new instance of the model class. You can think of it as making a new \"copy\" of a standard \"template\" for a model. In code, this looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_model = LinearRegression()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Fit the model to the `X` design matrix and `Y` target vector. This calculates the optimal model parameters \"behind the scenes\" without us explicitly working through the calculations ourselves. The fitted parameters are then stored within the model for use in future predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_model.fit(X, Y)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Use the fitted model to make predictions on the `X` input data using `.predict`. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_model.predict(X)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract the fitted parameters, we can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_model.coef_\n",
    "\n",
    "  my_model.intercept_\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put this into action with our multiple regression task!\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Initialize an instance of the model class**\n",
    "\n",
    "`sklearn` stores \"templates\" of useful models for machine learning. We begin the modeling process by making a \"copy\" of one of these templates for our own use. Model initialization looks like `ModelClass()`, where `ModelClass` is the type of model we wish to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's create a linear regression model using `LinearRegression`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`my_model` is now an instance of the `LinearRegression` class. You can think of it as the \"idea\" of a linear regression model. We haven't trained it yet, so it doesn't know any model parameters and cannot be used to make predictions. In fact, we haven't even told it what data to use for modeling! It simply waits for further instructions.\n"

What happens when we have more complex models with different, more complex loss functions? The techniques we've learned so far will not work, so we need a new optimization technique: **gradient descent**. \n",
