    "* Build awareness of issues with data faithfulness and develop targeted solutions\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past few lectures, we've learned that `pandas` is a toolkit to restructure, modify, and explore a dataset. What we haven't yet touched on is *how* to make these data transformation decisions. When we receive a new set of data from the \"real world,\" how do we know what processing we should do to convert this data into a usable form?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data cleaning**, also called **data wrangling**, is the process of transforming raw data to facilitate subsequent analysis. It is often used to address issues like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unclear structure or formatting\n",
    "* Missing or corrupted values\n",
    "* Unit conversions\n",
    "* ...and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of understanding a new dataset. It is an open-ended, informal analysis that involves familiarizing ourselves with the variables present in the data, discovering potential hypotheses, and identifying possible issues with the data. This last point can often motivate further data cleaning to address any problems with the dataset's format; because of this, EDA and data cleaning are often thought of as an \"infinite loop,\" with each process driving the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will consider the key properties of data to consider when performing data cleaning and EDA. In doing so, we'll develop a \"checklist\" of sorts for you to consider when approaching a new dataset. Throughout this process, we'll build a deeper understanding of this early (but very important!) stage of the data science lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "We often prefer rectangular data for data analysis. Rectangular structures are easy to manipulate and analyze. A key element of data cleaning is about transforming data to be more rectangular. \n",

    "### File Formats\n",
    "There are many file types for storing structured data: TSV, JSON, XML, ASCII, SAS, etc. We'll only cover CSV, TSV, and JSON in lecture, but you'll likely encounter other formats as you work with different datasets. Reading documentation is your best bet for understanding how to process the multitude of different file types. \n",

However, not all data comes like this, and there are also different kinds of data we can use. Some examples include:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Variable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are columns. A variable is a measurement of a particular concept. Variables have two common properties: data type/storage type and variable type/feature type. The data type of a variable indicates how each variable value is stored in memory (integer, floating point, boolean, etc.) and affects which `pandas` functions are used. The variable type is a conceptualized measurement of information (and therefore indicates what values a variable can take on). Variable type is identified through expert knowledge, exploring the data itself, or consulting the data codebook. The variable type affects how one visualizes and inteprets the data. In this class, \"variable types\" are conceptual.\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading data into a file, it's a good idea to take the time to understand what pieces of information are encoded in the dataset. In particular, we want to identify what variable types are present in our data. Broadly speaking, we can categorize variables into one of two overarching types. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantitative variables** describe some numeric quantity or amount. Some examples include weights, GPA, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, someone's age, or the number of siblings they have.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Qualitative variables**, also known as **categorical variables**, describe data that isn't measuring some quantity or amount. The sub-categories of categorical data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ordinal qualitative variables**: categories with ordered levels. Specifically, ordinal variables are those where the difference between levels has no consistent, quantifiable meaning. Some examples include levels of education (high school, undergrad, grad, etc.), income bracket (low, medium, high), or Yelp rating. \n",
    "* **Nominal qualitative variables**: categories with no specific order. For example, someone's political affiliation or Cal ID number.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Classification of variable types](images/variable_types.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that many variables don't sit neatly in just one of these categories. Qualitative variables could have numeric levels, and conversely, quantitative variables could be stored as strings. \n",

    "## Granularity and Temporality\n",
    "\n",
    "After understanding the structure of the dataset, the next task is to determine what exactly the data represents. We'll do so by considering the data's granularity and temporality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Granularity\n",
    "The **granularity** of a dataset is what a single row represents. You can also think of it as the level of detail included in the data. To determine the data's granularity, ask: what does each row in the dataset represent? Fine-grained data contains a high level of detail, with a single row representing a small individual unit. For example, each record may represent one person. Coarse-grained data is encoded such that a single row represents a large individual unit – for example, each record may represent a group of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporality\n",
    "The **temporality** of a dataset describes the periodicity over which the data was collected as well as when the data was most recently collected or updated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Time and date fields of a dataset could represent a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. when the \"event\" happened\n",
    "2. when the data was collected, or when it was entered into the system\n",
    "3. when the data was copied into the database \n",
    "\n",
    "To fully understand the temporality of the data, it also may be necessary to standardize time zones or inspect recurring time-based trends in the data (do patterns recur in 24-hour periods? Over the course of a month? Seasonally?). The convention for standardizing time is the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), an international time standard measured at 0 degrees latitude that stays consistent throughout the year (no daylight savings). We can represent Berkeley's time zone, Pacific Standard Time (PST), as UTC-7 (with daylight savings). \n",

    "## Faithfulness\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage in our data cleaning and EDA workflow, we've achieved quite a lot: we've identified how our data is structured, come to terms with what information it encodes, and gained insight as to how it was generated. Throughout this process, we should always recall the original intent of our work in Data Science – to use data to better understand and model the real world. To achieve this goal, we need to ensure that the data we use is faithful to reality; that is, that our data accurately captures the \"real world.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Data used in research or industry is often \"messy\" – there may be errors or inaccuracies that impact the faithfulness of the dataset. Signs that data may not be faithful include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unrealistic or \"incorrect\" values, such as negative counts, locations that don't exist, or dates set in the future\n",
    "* Violations of obvious dependencies, like an age that does not match a birthday\n",
    "* Clear signs that data was entered by hand, which can lead to spelling errors or fields that are incorrectly shifted\n",
    "* Signs of data falsification, such as fake email addresses or repeated use of the same names\n",
    "* Duplicated records or fields containing the same information\n",
    "* Truncated data, e.g. Microsoft Excel would limit the number of rows to 655536 and the number of columns to 255\n",
    "\n",
    "We often solve some of these more common issues in the following ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Spelling errors: apply corrections or drop records that aren't in a dictionary\n",
    "* Time zone inconsistencies: convert to a common time zone (e.g. UTC) \n",
    "* Duplicated records or fields: identify and eliminate duplicates (using primary keys)\n",
    "* Unspecified or inconsistent units: infer the units and check that values are in reasonable ranges in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Values\n",
    "Another common issue encountered with real-world datasets is that of missing data. One strategy to resolve this is to simply drop any records with missing values from the dataset. This does, however, introduce the risk of inducing biases – it is possible that the missing or corrupt records may be systemically related to some feature of interest in the data. Another solution is to keep the data as `NaN` values. \n",
    "\n",
    "A third method to address missing data is to perform **imputation**: infer the missing values using other data available in the dataset. There is a wide variety of imputation techniques that can be implemented; some of the most common are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Average imputation: replace missing values with the average value for that field\n",
    "* Hot deck imputation: replace missing values with some random value\n",
    "* Regression imputation: develop a model to predict missing values and replace with the predicted value from the model.\n",
    "* Multiple imputation: replace missing values with multiple random values\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the strategy used to deal with missing data, we should think carefully about *why* particular records or fields may be missing – this can help inform whether or not the absence of these values is significant or meaningful.\n",

    "* Examine the **data and metadata**: what is the date, size, organization, and structure of the data? \n",
    "* Examine each **field/attribute/dimension** individually.\n",
    "* Examine pairs of related dimensions (e.g. breaking down grades by major).\n",
    "* Along the way, we can:\n",

    "    * **Validate assumptions** about data and its collection process. Pay particular attention to when the data was collected. \n",
    "    * Identify and **address anomalies**.\n",
