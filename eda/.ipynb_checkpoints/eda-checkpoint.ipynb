    "In the past few lectures, we've learned that `pandas` is a toolkit to restructure, modify, and explore a dataset. What we haven't yet touched on is *how* to make these data transformation decisions. When we receive a new set of data from the \"real world,\" how do we know what processing we should do to convert this data into a usable form?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data cleaning**, also called **data wrangling**, is the process of transforming raw data to facilitate subsequent analysis. It is often used to address issues like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unclear structure or formatting\n",
    "* Missing or corrupted values\n",
    "* Unit conversions\n",
    "* ...and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of understanding a new dataset. It is an open-ended, informal analysis that involves familiarizing ourselves with the variables present in the data, discovering potential hypotheses, and identifying potential issues with the data. This last point can often motivate further data cleaning to address any problems with the dataset's format; because of this, EDA and data cleaning are often thought of as an \"infinite loop,\" with each process driving the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will consider the key properties of data to consider when performing data cleaning and EDA. In doing so, we'll develop a \"checklist\" of sorts for you to consider when approaching a new dataset. Throughout this process, we'll build a deeper understanding of this early (but very important!) stage of the data science lifecycle.\n",

Continuous variables do not have a strict set of possible values – they can be recorded to any number of decimal places. For example, weights, GPA, or CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations\n",

    "## Granularity, Scope, and Temporality\n",
    "\n",
    "After understanding the structure of the dataset, the next task is to determine what exactly the data represents. We'll do so by considering the data's granularity, scope, and temporality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **granularity** of a dataset is the level of detail included in the data. To determine the data's granularity, ask: what does each row in the dataset represent? Fine-grained data contains a high level of detail, with a single row representing a small individual unit. For example, each record may represent one person. Coarse-grained data is encoded such that a single row represents a large individual unit – for example, each record may represent a group of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **scope** of a dataset is the subset of the population covered by the data. If we were investigating student performance in Data Science courses, a dataset with narrow scope might encompass all students enrolled in Data 100; a dataset with expansive scope might encompass all students in California. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **temporality** of a dataset describes the time period over which the data was collected. To fully understand the temporality of the data, it may be necessary to standardize timezones or inspect recurring time-based trends in the data (Do patterns recur in 24-hour patterns? Over the course of a month? Seasonally?).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Faithfulness\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage in our data cleaning and EDA workflow, we've achieved quite a lot: we've identified how our data is structured, come to terms with what information it encodes, and gained insight as to how it was generated. Throughout this process, we should always recall the original intent of our work in Data Science – to use data to better understand and model the real world. To achieve this goal, we need to ensure that the data we use is faithful to reality; that is, that our data accurately captures the \"real world.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Data used in research or industry is often \"messy\" – there may be errors or inaccuracies that impact the faithfulness of the dataset. Signs that data may not be faithful include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unrealistic or \"incorrect\" values, such as negative counts, locations that don't exist, or dates set in the future\n",
    "* Violations of obvious dependencies, like an age that does not match a birthday\n",
    "* Clear signs that data was entered by hand, which can lead to spelling errors or fields that are incorrectly shifted\n",
    "* Signs of data falsification, such as fake email addresses or repeated use of the same names\n",
    "* Duplicated records or fields containing the same information\n",
    "\n",
    "A common issue encountered with real-world datasets is that of missing data. One strategy to resolve this is to simply drop any records with missing values from the dataset. This does, however, introduce the risk of inducing biases – it is possible that the missing or corrupt records may be systemically related to some feature of interest in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method to address missing data is to perform **imputation**: infer the missing values using other data available in the dataset. There is a wide variety of imputation techniques that can be implemented; some of the most common are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Average imputation: replace missing values with the average value for that field\n",
    "* Hot deck imputation: replace missing values with some random value\n",
    "* Regression imputation: develop a model to predict missing values\n",
    "* Multiple imputation: replace missing values with multiple random values\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the strategy used to deal with missing data, we should think carefully about *why* particular records or fields may be missing – this can help inform whether or not the absence of these values is signficant in some meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "# EDA Demo: Tuberculosis in the United States\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's follow this data-cleaning and EDA workflow to see what can we say about the presence of Tuberculosis in the United States!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine the data included in the [original CDC article](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7112a1.htm?s_cid=mm7112a1_w#T1_down) published in 2021.\n",

    "## CSVs and Field Names\n",
    "Suppose Table 1 was saved as a CSV file located in `data/cdc_tuberculosis.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then explore the CSV (which is a text file, and does not contain binary-encoded data) in many ways:\n",
    "1. Using a text editor like emacs, vim, VSCode, etc.\n",
    "2. Opening the CSV directly in DataHub (read-only), Excel, Google Sheets, etc.\n",
    "3. The Python file object\n",
    "4. pandas, using `pd.read_csv()`\n",
    "\n",
    "1, 2. Let's start with the first two so we really solidify the idea of a CSV as **rectangular data (i.e., tabular data) stored as comma-separated values**.\n",
