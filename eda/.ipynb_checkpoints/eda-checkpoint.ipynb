    "In the past few lectures, we've learned that `pandas` is a toolkit to restructure, modify, and explore a dataset.

    "**Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** is the process of understanding a new dataset. It is an open-ended, informal analysis that involves familiarizing ourselves with the variables present in the data, discovering potential hypotheses, and identifying potential issues with the data. This last point can often motivate further data cleaning to address any problems with the dataset's format; because of this, EDA and data cleaning are often thought of as an \"infinite loop,\" with each process driving the other.\n",

In doing so, we'll develop a \"checklist\" of sorts for you to consider when approaching a new dataset.

    "\n",
    "After understanding the structure of the dataset, the next task is to determine what exactly the data represents. We'll do so by considering the data's granularity, scope, and temporality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **granularity** of a dataset is the level of detail included in the data. To determine the data's granularity, ask: what does each row in the dataset represent? Fine-grained data contains a high level of detail, with a single row representing a small individual unit. For example, each record may represent one person. Coarse-grained data is encoded such that a single row represents a large individual unit â for example, each record may represent a group of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **scope** of a dataset is the subset of the population covered by the data. If we were investigating student performance in Data Science courses, a dataset with narrow scope might encompass all students enrolled in Data 100; a dataset with expansive scope might encompass all students in California. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **temporality** of a dataset describes the time period over which the data was collected. To fully understand the temporality of the data, it may be necessary to standardize timezones or inspect recurring time-based trends in the data (Do patterns recur in 24-hour patterns? Over the course of a month? Seasonally?)."

    "## Faithfulness\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage in our data wangling and EDA workflow, we've achieved quite a lot: we've identified how our data is structured, come to terms with what information it encodes, and gained insight as to how it was generated. Throughout this process, we should always recall the original intent of our work in Data Science â to use data to better understand and model the real world. To achieve this goal, we need to ensure that the data we use is faithful to reality; that is, that our data accurately captures the \"real world.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Data used in research or industry is often \"messy\" â there may be errors or inaccuracies that impact the faithfulness of the dataset. Signs that data may not be faithful include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unrealistic or \"incorrect\" values, such as negative counts, locations that don't exist, or dates set in the future\n",
    "* Violations of obvious dependencies, like an age that does not match a birthday\n",
    "* Clear signs that data was entered by hand, which can lead to spelling errors or fields that are incorrectly shifted\n",
    "* Signs of data falsification, such as fake email addresses or repeated use of the same names\n",
    "* Duplicated records or fields containing the same information\n",
    "\n",
    "A common issue encountered with real-world datasets is that of missing data. One strategy to resolve this is to simply drop any records with missing values from the dataset. This does, however, introduce the risk of inducing biases â it is possible that the missing or corrupt records may be systemically related to some feature of interest in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method to address missing data is to perform **imputation**: infer the missing values using other data available in the dataset. There is a wide variety of imputation techniques that can be implemented; some of the most common are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Average imputation: replace missing values with the average value for that field\n",
    "* Hot deck imputation: replace missing values with some random value\n",
    "* Regression imputation: develop a model to predict missing values\n",
    "* Multiple imputation: replace missing values with multiple random values\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the strategy used to deal with missing data, we should think carefully about *why* particular records or fields may be missing â this can help inform whether or not the absence of these values is signficant in some meaningful way."
