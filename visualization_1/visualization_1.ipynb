    "In our journey of the data science lifecycle, we have begun to explore the vast world of exploratory data analysis. More recently, we learned how to pre-process data using various data manipulation techniques. As we work towards understanding our data, there is one key component missing in our arsenal — the ability to visualize and discern relationships in existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These next two lectures will introduce you to various examples of data visualizations and their underlying theory. In doing so, we'll motivate their importance in real-world examples with the use of plotting libraries.\n",

    "## Visualizations in Data 8 and Data 100 (so far)\n",
    "\n",
    "You've likely encountered several forms of data visualizations in your studies. You may remember two such examples from Data 8: line plots, scatter plots, and histograms. Each of these served a unique purpose. For example, line plots displayed how numerical quantities changed over time, while histograms were useful in understanding a variable's distribution. \n",

    "## Goals of Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations are useful for a number of reasons. In Data 100, we consider two areas in particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To broaden your understanding of the data. Summarizing trends visually before in-depth analysis is a key part of exploratory data analysis. Creating these graphs is a lightweight, iterative and flexible process that helps us investigate relationships between variables.\n",
    "2. To communicate results/conclusions to others. These visualizations are highly editorial, selective, and fine-tuned to achieve a communications goal, so be thoughtful and careful about its clarity, accessibility, and necessary context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Altogether, these goals emphasize the fact that visualizations aren't a matter of making \"pretty\" pictures; we need to do a lot of thinking about what stylistic choices communicate ideas most effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course note will focus on the first half of visualization topics in Data 100. The goal here is to understand how to choose the \"right\" plot depending on different variable types and, secondly, how to generate these plots using code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Overview of Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "A distribution describes both the set of values that a single variable can take and the frequency of unique values in a single variable. For example, if we're interested in the distribution of students across Data 100 discussion sections, the set of possible values is a list of discussion sections (10-11am, 11-12pm, etc.), and the frequency that each of those values occur is the number of students enrolled in each section. In other words, we're interested in how a variable is distributed across it's possible values. Therefore, distributions must satisfy two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. The total frequency of all categories must sum to 100%\n",
    "   2. Total count should sum to the total number of datapoints if we're using raw counts.\n",
    "   \n",
    "| Not a Valid Distribution | Valid Distribution | \n",
    "| --- | --- | \n",
    "| <img src=\"images/bad_distro.png\" alt='bad_distro' width='350'> | <img src=\"images/good_distro.png\" alt='good_distro' width='300'> | \n",
    "| This is not a valid distribution since individuals can be associated with more than one category and the bar values demonstrate values in minutes and not probability. | This example satisfies the two properties of distributions, so it is a valid distribution. | \n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Types Should Inform Plot Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "Different plots are more or less suited for displaying particular types of variables, laid out in the diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src = \"images/variables.png\" width = \"500\"></img></a></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of any visualization is to identify the type(s) of variables we're working with. From here, we can select an appropriate plot type: \n",
    "\n",
    "## Qualitative Variables: Bar Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "A **bar plot** is one of the most common ways of displaying the **distribution** of a **qualitative** (categorical) variable. The length of a bar plot encodes the frequency of a category; the width encodes no useful information. The color *could* indicate a sub-category, but this is not necessarily the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's contextualize this in an example. We will use the World Bank dataset (`wb`) in our analysis."

    "A **kernel** is a density curve. It is the mathematical function that attempts to capture the randomness of each data point in our sampled data. To explain what this means, consider just *one* of the datapoints in our dataset: $2.2$. We obtained this datapoint by randomly sampling some information out in the real world (you can imagine $2.2$ as representing a single measurement taken in an experiment, for example). If we were to sample a new datapoint, we may obtain a slightly different value. It could be higher than $2.2$; it could also be lower than $2.2$. We make the assumption that any future sampled datapoints will likely be similar in value to the data we've already drawn. This means that our *kernel* – our description of the probability of randomly sampling any new value – will be greatest at the datapoint we've already drawn but still have non-zero probability above and below it. The area under any kernel should integrate to 1, representing the total probability of drawing a new datapoint.\n",
