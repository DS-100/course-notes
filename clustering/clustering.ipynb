    "### Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"Supervised Learning\", our goal is to create a function that maps inputs to outputs. Each model is learned from example input/output pairs (training set), validated using input/output pairs, and eventually tested on more input/output pairs. Each pair consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Input vector\n",
    "* Output value (**label**)\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression, our output value is quantitative, and in classification, our output value is categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ML taxonomy](images/ml_taxonomy.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"Unsupervised Learning\", our goal is to identify patterns in unlabeled data. In this type of learning, we do not have input/output pairs. Sometimes we may have labels, but we’re just choosing to ignore them (e.g. PCA on labeled data). Instead, we are more interested in the inherent structure of the data we have, rather than trying to simply predict a label using that structure of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we are interested in dimensionality reduction, we can use PCA to reduce our data to a lower dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us consider a new problem: clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "Consider the figure shown from Fall 2019 Midterm 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/blobs.png\" alt='blobs' width='600'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each point represents the 1st and 2nd principal component of how much time patrons spent at 8 different zoo exhibits.\n",
    "The original dataset was 8 dimensions, but we have used PCA to reduce our data down to 2 dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually and intuitively, we could potentially guess that this data belongs to 3 groups: one for each cluster. The goal of clustering is now to assign each point (in the 2 dimensional PCA representation) to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/clusters_ex1.png\" alt='clusters_ex1' width='600'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an unsupervised task:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We don’t have labels for each visitor.\n",
    "* Want to infer patterns even without labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Netflix\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose you're Netflix and are looking at information on customer viewing habits. Clustering can come in handy here. We can assign each person or show to a \"cluster\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that with clustering, we don't need to define clusters in advance. This marks one of the key differences between clustering and classification. With classification, we have to decide on labels in advance whereas clustering discovers groups automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: while we don't know for sure that Netflix actually uses ML clustering to identify these categories, they could in principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Education \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we're working with student-generated materials and pass them into the S-BERT module to extract sentence embeddings. Features from clusters are extracted to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detect anomalies in group activities\n",
    "* Predict the group's median quiz grade \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/outline-ex3.png\" alt='outline-ex3' width='600'></center>\n",

    "Here we can see the outline of the anomaly detection module. It consists of:\n",

    "* S-BERT feature extraction\n",
    "* Topic extraction\n",
    "* Feature extraction\n",
    "* 16D $\\rightarrow$ 2D PCA dimensionality reduction and 2D $\\rightarrow$ 16D reconstruction\n",
    "* Anomaly detection based on reconstruction error\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking more closely at our clustering, we can better understand the different components as represented by centers. Below we have two examples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/components.png\" alt='components' width='600'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the details for this example are not in scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 4: Reverse Engineering Biology\n",
    "Now, consider the plot below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/genes.png\" alt='genes' width='600'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The rows of this plot are conditions (e.g. a row might be: “poured acid on the cells”) and the columns are genes. The green coloration indicates that the gene was ~off (red indicates the gene was ~on). For example, the ~9 genes in the top left corner of the plot were all turned off by the 6 experiments (rows) at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a clustering lens, we might be interested in clustering similar observations together based on the reactions (on/off) to certain experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is a look at our data before and after clustering. \n",

    "* Pick an arbitrary $K$, and randomly place $K$ \"centers\", each a different color.\n",

    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/cluster_class.png\" alt='cluster_class' width='600'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will move the center for each color to the center of points with that color. Notice how the centers are generally well-centered amongst the data that shares its color.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/cluster_iter1.png\" alt='cluster_iter1' width='600'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume this process (re-color, re-set centers) repeats for a few more iterations, and now we've ended up at this state.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/cluster_iter5.png\" alt='cluster_iter5' width='600'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "After this iteration, the center stays still and does not move at all. Thus, we have converged, and the clustering is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick note: K-Means is a totally different algorithm than “K-Nearest Neighbors”.\n",
    "\n",
    "* K-Means: Used for clustering.\n",
    "    * Assign each point to one of $K$ clusters.\n",
    "* K-Nearest Neighbors: Used for classification (or less often, regression).\n",

    "\n",

Additionally, another case where $S = 1$ could happen is if $B >> A$.\n",
