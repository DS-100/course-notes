    "text": "20.1 Databases\nWith this goal in mind, let’s go back to the very beginning of the lifecycle. We first started our work in data analysis by looking at the pandas library, which offered us powerful tools to manipulate tabular data stored in (primarily) CSV files. CSVs work well when analyzing relatively small datasets that don’t need to be shared across many users. In research and industry, however, data scientists often need to access enormous bodies of data that cannot be easily stored in a CSV format. Collaborating with others when working with CSVs can also be tricky – a real-world data scientist may run into problems when multiple users try to make modifications, or, even worse, security issues with who should and should not have access to the data.\nA database is a large, organized collection of data. Databases are administered by Database Management Systems (DBMS), which are software systems that store, manage, and facilitate access to one or more databases. Databases help mitigate many of the issues that come with using CSVs for data storage: they provide reliable storage that can survive system crashes or disk failures, are optimized to compute on data that does not fit into memory, and contain special data structures to improve performance. Using databases rather than CSVs offers further benefits from the standpoint of data management. A DBMS can apply settings that configure how data is organized, block certain data anomalies (for example, enforcing non-negative weights or ages), and determine who is allowed access to the data. It can also ensure safe concurrent operations where multiple users reading and writing to the database will not lead to fatal errors.\nAs you may have guessed, we can’t use our usual pandas methods to work with data in a database. Instead, we’ll turn to Structured Query Language."

    "section": "20.2 Structured Query Language and Database Schema",
    "text": "20.2 Structured Query Language and Database Schema\nStructured Query Language, or SQL (commonly pronounced “sequel,” though this is the subject of fierce debate), is a special programming language designed to communicate with databases. You may have encountered it in classes like CS 61A or Data C88C before. Unlike Python, it is a declarative programming language – this means that rather than writing the exact logic needed to complete a task, a piece of SQL code “declares” what the desired final output should be and leaves the program to determine what logic should be implemented.\nIt is important to reiterate that SQL is an entirely different language from Python. However, Python does have special engines that allow us to run SQL code in a Jupyter notebook. While this is typically not how SQL is used outside of an educational setting, we will be using this workflow to illustrate how SQL queries are constructed using the tools we’ve already worked with this semester. You will learn more about how to run SQL queries in Jupyter in Lab 10.\nThe syntax below will seem unfamiliar to you; for now, just focus on understanding the output displayed. We will clarify the SQL code in a bit.\nTo start, we’ll look at a database called basic_examples.db.\n\n# Load the SQL Alchemy Python library\nimport sqlalchemy\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\n# load %%sql cell magic\n%load_ext sql\n\nConnect to the SQLite database basic_examples.db.\n\n%%sql\nsqlite:///data/basic_examples.db \n\n\n%%sql\nSELECT * \nFROM sqlite_master\nWHERE type=\"table\"\n\n * sqlite:///data/basic_examples.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\nname\ntbl_name\nrootpage\nsql\n\n\n\n\ntable\nsqlite_sequence\nsqlite_sequence\n7\nCREATE TABLE sqlite_sequence(name,seq)\n\n\ntable\nDragon\nDragon\n2\nCREATE TABLE Dragon (\nname TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\nyear INTEGER CHECK (year &gt;= 2000),\ncute INTEGER\n)\n\n\ntable\nDish\nDish\n4\nCREATE TABLE Dish (\nname TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\ntype TEXT,\ncost INTEGER CHECK (cost &gt;= 0)\n)\n\n\ntable\nScene\nScene\n6\nCREATE TABLE Scene (\nid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\nbiome TEXT NOT NULL,\ncity TEXT NOT NULL,\nvisitors INTEGER CHECK (visitors &gt;= 0),\ncreated_at DATETIME DEFAULT (DATETIME('now'))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe summary above displays information about the database. The database contains four tables, named sqlite_sequence, Dragon, Dish, and Scene. The rightmost column above lists the command that was used to construct each table.\nLet’s look more closely at the command used to create the Dragon table (the second entry above).\nCREATE TABLE Dragon (name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n                     year INTEGER CHECK (year &gt;= 2000),\n                     cute INTEGER)\nThe statement CREATE TABLE is used to specify the schema of the table – a description of what logic is used to organize the table. Schema follows a set format:\n\nColName: the name of a column\nDataType: the type of data to be stored in a column. Some of the most common SQL data types are INT (integers), FLOAT (floating point numbers), TEXT (strings), BLOB (arbitrary data, such as audio/video files), and DATETIME (a date and time).\nConstraint: some restriction on the data to be stored in the column. Common constraints are CHECK (data must obey a certain condition), PRIMARY KEY (designate a column as the table’s primary key), NOT NULL (data cannot be null), and DEFAULT (a default fill value if no specific entry is given).\n\nWe see that Dragon contains three columns. The first of these, \"name\", contains text data. It is designated as the primary key of the table; that is, the data contained in \"name\" uniquely identifies each entry in the table. Because \"name\" is the primary key of the table, no two entries in the table can have the same name – a given value of \"name\" is unique to each dragon. The \"year\" column contains integer data, with the constraint that year values must be greater than or equal to 2000. The final column, \"cute\", contains integer data with no restrictions on allowable values.\nWe can verify this by viewing Dragon itself.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT *\nFROM Dragon\n\n * sqlite:///data/basic_examples.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nyear\ncute\n\n\n\n\nhiccup\n2010\n10\n\n\ndrogon\n2011\n-100\n\n\ndragon 2\n2019\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase tables (also referred to as relations) are structured much like DataFrames in pandas. Each row, sometimes called a tuple, represents a single record in the dataset. Each column, sometimes called an attribute or field, describes some feature of the record."

    "section": "20.3 SELECTing From Tables",
    "text": "20.3 SELECTing From Tables\nTo extract and manipulate data stored in a SQL table, we will need to familiarize ourselves with the syntax to write pieces of SQL code, which we call queries.\nThe basic unit of a SQL query is the SELECT statement. SELECT specifies what columns we would like to extract from a given table. We use FROM to tell SQL the table from which we want to SELECT our data.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT *\nFROM Dragon\n\n * sqlite:///data/basic_examples.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nyear\ncute\n\n\n\n\nhiccup\n2010\n10\n\n\ndrogon\n2011\n-100\n\n\ndragon 2\n2019\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn SQL, * means “everything.” The query above grabs all the columns in Dragon and displays them in the outputted table. We can also specify a specific subset of columns to be SELECTed. Notice that the outputted columns appear in the order that they were SELECTed.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT cute, year\nFROM Dragon\n\n * sqlite:///data/basic_examples.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\ncute\nyear\n\n\n\n\n10\n2010\n\n\n-100\n2011\n\n\n0\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd just like that, we’ve already written two SQL queries. There are a few points of note in the queries above. Firstly, notice that every “verb” is written in uppercase. It is convention to write SQL operations in capital letters, but your code will run just fine even if you choose to keep things in lowercase. Second, the query above separates each statement with a new line. SQL queries are not impacted by whitespace within the query; this means that SQL code is typically written with a new line after each statement to make things more readable. The semicolon (;) indicates the end of a query. There are some “flavors” of SQL in which a query will not run if no semicolon is present; however, in Data 100, the SQL version we will use works with or without an ending semicolon. Queries in these notes will end with semicolons to build up good habits.\nThe AS keyword allows us to give a column a new name (called an alias) after it has been SELECTed. The general syntax is:\nSELECT column_name_in_database_table AS new_name_in_output_table\n\n%%sql\nSELECT cute AS cuteness, year AS birth\nFROM Dragon\n\n * sqlite:///data/basic_examples.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\ncuteness\nbirth\n\n\n\n\n10\n2010\n\n\n-100\n2011\n\n\n0\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\nTo SELECT only the unique values in a column, we use the DISTINCT keyword. This will cause any any duplicate entries in a column to be removed. If we want to find only the unique years in Dragon, without any repeats, we would write:\n\n%%sql\nSELECT DISTINCT year\nFROM Dragon\n\n * sqlite:///data/basic_examples.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n2011\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery SQL query must include both a SELECT and FROM statement. Intuitively, this makes sense – we know that we’ll want to extract some piece of information from the table; to do so, we also need to indicate what table we want to consider.\nIt is important to note that SQL enforces a strict “order of operations” – SQL clauses must always follow the same sequence. For example, the SELECT statement must always precede FROM. This means that any SQL query will follow the same structure.\nSELECT &lt;column list&gt;\nFROM &lt;table&gt;\n[additional clauses]\nThe additional clauses that we use depend on the specific task trying to be achieved. We may refine our query to filter on a certain condition, aggregate a particular column, or join several tables together. We will spend the rest of this lecture outlining some useful clauses to build up our understanding of the order of operations."

We know that SELECT and FROM are the fundamental building blocks of any SQL query. We can augment these two keywords with additional clauses to refine the data in our output table.\nAny clauses that we include must follow a strict ordering within the query:\nSELECT &lt;column list&gt;\nFROM &lt;table&gt;\n[WHERE &lt;predicate&gt;]\n[ORDER BY &lt;column list&gt;]\n[LIMIT &lt;number of rows&gt;]\n[OFFSET &lt;number of rows&gt;]\nHere, any clause contained in square brackets [ ] is optional – we only need to use the keyword if it is relevant to the table operation we want to perform. Also note that by convention, we use all caps for keywords in SQL statements and use newlines to make code more readable."

    "title": "20  SQL I",
    "section": "20.6 Aggregating with GROUP BY",
    "text": "20.6 Aggregating with GROUP BY\nAt this point, we’ve seen that SQL offers much of the same functionality that was given to us by pandas. We can extract data from a table, filter it, and reorder it to suit our needs.\nIn pandas, much of our analysis work relied heavily on being able to use .groupby() to aggregate across the rows of our dataset. SQL’s answer to this task is the (very conveniently named) GROUP BY clause. While the outputs of GROUP BY are similar to those of .groupby() – in both cases, we obtain an output table where some column has been used for grouping – the syntax and logic used to group data in SQL are fairly different to the pandas implementation.\nTo illustrate GROUP BY, we will consider the Dish table from the basic_examples.db database.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT * \nFROM Dish\n\n * sqlite:///data/basic_examples.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nname\ntype\ncost\n\n\n\n\nravioli\nentree\n10\n\n\nramen\nentree\n13\n\n\ntaco\nentree\n7\n\n\nedamame\nappetizer\n4\n\n\nfries\nappetizer\n4\n\n\npotsticker\nappetizer\n4\n\n\nice cream\ndessert\n5\n\n\n\n\n\nSay we wanted to find the total costs of dishes of a certain type. To accomplish this, we would write the following code.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT type, SUM(cost)\nFROM Dish\nGROUP BY type\n\n * sqlite:///data/basic_examples.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\nSUM(cost)\n\n\n\n\nappetizer\n12\n\n\ndessert\n5\n\n\nentree\n30\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is going on here? The statement GROUP BY type tells SQL to group the data based on the value contained in the type column (whether a record is an appetizer, entree, or dessert). SUM(cost) sums up the costs of dishes in each type and displays the result in the output table.\nYou may be wondering: why does SUM(cost) come before the command to GROUP BY type? Don’t we need to form groups before we can count the number of entries in each?\nRemember that SQL is a declarative programming language – a SQL programmer simply states what end result they would like to see, and leaves the task of figuring out how to obtain this result to SQL itself. This means that SQL queries sometimes don’t follow what a reader sees as a “logical” sequence of thought. Instead, SQL requires that we follow its set order of operations when constructing queries. So long as we follow this ordering, SQL will handle the underlying logic.\nIn practical terms: our goal with this query was to output the total costs of each type. To communicate this to SQL, we say that we want to SELECT the SUMmed cost values for each type group.\nThere are many aggregation functions that can be used to aggregate the data contained in each group. Some common examples are:\n\nCOUNT: count the number of rows associated with each group\nMIN: find the minimum value of each group\nMAX: find the maximum value of each group\nSUM: sum across all records in each group\nAVG: find the average value of each group\n\nWe can easily compute multiple aggregations, all at once (a task that was very tricky in pandas).\n\n%%sql\nSELECT type, SUM(cost), MIN(cost), MAX(name)\nFROM Dish\nGROUP BY type\n\n * sqlite:///data/basic_examples.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\nSUM(cost)\nMIN(cost)\nMAX(name)\n\n\n\n\nappetizer\n12\n4\npotsticker\n\n\ndessert\n5\n5\nice cream\n\n\nentree\n30\n7\ntaco\n\n\n\n\n\nTo count the number of rows associated with each group, we use the COUNT keyword. Calling COUNT(*) will compute the total number of rows in each group, including rows with null values. Its pandas equivalent is .groupby().size().\n\n%%sql\nSELECT type, COUNT(*)\nFROM Dish\nGROUP BY type\n\n * sqlite:///data/basic_examples.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\nCOUNT(*)\n\n\n\n\nappetizer\n3\n\n\ndessert\n1\n\n\nentree\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nTo exclude NULL values when counting the rows in each group, we explicitly call COUNT on a column in the table. This is similar to calling .groupby().count() in pandas.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT year, COUNT(cute)\nFROM Dragon\nGROUP BY year\n\n * sqlite:///data/basic_examples.db\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nCOUNT(cute)\n\n\n\n\n2010\n1\n\n\n2011\n1\n\n\n2019\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this definition of GROUP BY in hand, let’s update our SQL order of operations. Remember: every SQL query must list clauses in this order.\nSELECT &lt;column expression list&gt;\nFROM &lt;table&gt;\n[WHERE &lt;predicate&gt;]\n[GROUP BY &lt;column list&gt;]\n[ORDER BY &lt;column list&gt;]\n[LIMIT &lt;number of rows&gt;]\n[OFFSET &lt;number of rows&gt;];\nNote that we can use the AS keyword to rename columns during the selection process and that column expressions may include aggregation functions (MAX, MIN, etc.)."
