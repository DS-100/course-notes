    "section": "Data Science Lifecycle",
    "text": "Data Science Lifecycle\nThe data science lifecycle is a high-level overview of the data science workflow. It’s a cycle of stages that a data scientist should explore as they conduct a thorough analysis of a data-driven problem.\nThere are many variations of the key ideas present in the data science lifecycle. In Data 100, we visualize the stages of the lifecycle using a flow diagram. Notice how there are two entry points.\n\n\nAsk a Question\nWhether by curiosity or necessity, data scientists constantly ask questions. For example, in the business world, data scientists may be interested in predicting the profit generated by a certain investment. In the field of medicine, they may ask whether some patients are more likely than others to benefit from a treatment.\nPosing questions is one of the primary ways the data science lifecycle begins. It helps to fully define the question. Here are some things you should ask yourself before framing a question.\n\nWhat do we want to know?\n\nA question that is too ambiguous may lead to confusion.\n\nWhat problems are we trying to solve?\n\nThe goal of asking a question should be clear in order to justify your efforts to stakeholders.\n\nWhat are the hypotheses we want to test?\n\nThis gives a clear perspective from which to analyze final results.\n\nWhat are the metrics for our success?\n\nThis establishes a clear point to know when to conclude the project.\n\n\n\n\n\nObtain Data\nThe second entry point to the lifecycle is by obtaining data. A careful analysis of any problem requires the use of data. Data may be readily available to us, or we may have to embark on a process to collect it. When doing so, it is crucial to ask the following:\n\nWhat data do we have, and what data do we need?\n\nDefine the units of the data (people, cities, points in time, etc.) and what features to measure.\n\nHow will we sample more data?\n\nScrape the web, collect manually, run experiments, etc.\n\nIs our data representative of the population we want to study?\n\nIf our data is not representative of our population of interest, then we cann come to incorrect conclusions.\n\n\nKey procedures: data acquisition, data cleaning\n\n\n\nUnderstand the Data\nRaw data itself is not inherently useful. It’s impossible to discern all the patterns and relationships between variables without carefully investigating them. Therefore, translating pure data into actionable insights is a key job of a data scientist. For example, we may choose to ask:\n\nHow is our data organized and what does it contain?\n\nKnowing what the data says about the world helps us better understand the world.\n\nDo we have relevant data?\n\nIf the data we have collected is not useful to the question at hand, then we must collect more data.\n\nWhat are the biases, anomalies, or other issues with the data?\n\nThese can lead to many false conclusions if ignored, so data scientists must always be aware of these issues.\n\nHow do we transform the data to enable effective analysis?\n\nData is not always easy to interpret at first glance, so a data scientist should strive to reveal the hidden insights.\n\n\nKey procedures: exploratory data analysis, data visualization.\n\n\n\nUnderstand the World\nAfter observing the patterns in our data, we can begin answering our question. This may require that we predict a quantity (machine learning), or measure the effect of some treatment (inference).\nFrom here, we may choose to report our results, or possibly conduct more analysis. We may not be satisfied with our findings, or our initial exploration may have brought up new questions that require new data.\n\nWhat does the data say about the world?\n\nGiven our models, the data will lead us to certain conclusions about the real world.\n\n\nDoes it answer our questions or accurately solve the problem?\n\nIf our model and data can not accomplish our goals, then we must reform our question, model, or both.\n\n\nHow robust are our conclusions and can we trust the predictions?\n\nInaccurate models can lead to false conclusions.\n\n\nKey procedures: model creation, prediction, inference."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe data science lifecycle is meant to be a set of general guidelines rather than a hard set of requirements. In our journey exploring the lifecycle, we’ll cover both the underlying theory and technologies used in data science. By the end of the course, we hope that you start to see yourself as a data scientist.\nWith that, we’ll begin by introducing one of the most important tools in exploratory data analysis: pandas."
