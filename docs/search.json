    "section": "1.1 Data Science Lifecycle",
    "text": "1.1 Data Science Lifecycle\nThe data science lifecycle is a high-level overview of the data science workflow. It’s a cycle of stages that a data scientist should explore as they conduct a thorough analysis of a data-driven problem.\nThere are many variations of the key ideas present in the data science lifecycle. In Data 100, we visualize the stages of the lifecycle using a flow diagram. Notice how there are two entry points.\n\n\n1.1.1 Ask a Question\nWhether by curiosity or necessity, data scientists will constantly ask questions. For example, in the business world, data scientists may be interested in predicting the profit generated by a certain investment. In the field of medicine, they may ask whether some patients are more likely than others to benefit from a treatment.\nPosing questions is one of the primary ways the data science lifecycle begins. It helps to fully define the question. Here are some things you should ask yourself before framing a question.\n\nWhat do we want to know?\n\nA question that is too ambiguous may lead to confusion.\n\nWhat problems are we trying to solve?\n\nThe goal of asking a question should be clear in order to justify your efforts to stakeholders.\n\nWhat are the hypotheses we want to test?\n\nThis gives a clear perspective from which to analyze final results.\n\nWhat are the metrics for our success?\n\nThis gives a clear point to know when to finish the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Obtain Data\nThe second entry point to the lifecycle is by obtaining data. A careful analysis of any problem requires the use of data. Data may be readily available to us, or we may have to embark on a process to collect it. When doing so, its crucial to ask the following:\n\nWhat data do we have and what data do we need?\n\nDefine the units of the data (people, cities, points in time, etc.) and what features to measure.\n\nHow will we sample more data?\n\nScrape the web, collect manually, etc.\n\nIs our data representative of the population we want to study?\n\nIf our data is not representative of our population of interest, then we can come to incorrect conclusions.\n\n\nKey procedures: data acquisition, data cleaning\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Understand the Data\nRaw data itself is not inherently useful. It’s impossible to discern all the patterns and relationships between variables without carefully investigating them. Therefore, translating pure data to actionable insights is a key job of a data scientist. For example, we may choose to ask:\n\nHow is our data organized and what does it contain?\n\nKnowing what the data says about the world helps us better understand the world.\n\nDo we have relevant data?\n\nIf the data we have collected is not useful to the question at hand, then we must collected more data.\n\nWhat are the biases, anomalies, or other issues with the data?\n\nThese can lead to many false conclusions if ignored, so data scientists must always be aware of these issues.\n\nHow do we transform the data to enable effective analysis?\n\nData is not always easy to interpret at first glance, so a data scientist should reveal these hidden insights.\n\n\nKey procedures: exploratory data analysis, data visualization.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Understand the World\nAfter observing the patterns in our data, we can begin answering our question. This may require that we predict a quantity (machine learning), or measure the effect of some treatment (inference).\nFrom here, we may choose to report our results, or possibly conduct more analysis. We may not be satisfied by our findings, or our initial exploration may have brought up new questions that require a new data.\n\nWhat does the data say about the world?\n\nGiven our models, the data will lead us to certain conclusions about the real world.\n\n\nDoes it answer our questions or accurately solve the problem?\n\nIf our model and data can not accomplish our goals, then we must reform our question, model, or both.\n\n\nHow robust are our conclusions and can we trust the predictions?\n\nInaccurate models can lead to untrue conclusions.\n\n\nKey procedures: model creation, prediction, inference."

    "text": "2.1 Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis\nImagine you collected, or have been given a box of data. What do you do next?\n\nThe first step is to clean your data. Data cleaning often corrects issues in the structure and formatting of data, including missing values and unit conversions.\nData scientists have coined the term exploratory data analysis (EDA) to describe the process of transforming raw data to insightful observations. EDA is an open-ended analysis of transforming, visualizing, and summarizing patterns in data. In order to conduct EDA, we first need to familiarize ourselves with pandas – an important programming tool."

    "section": "2.3 Series, DataFrames, and Indices",
    "text": "2.3 Series, DataFrames, and Indices\nThere are three fundamental data structures in pandas:\n\nSeries: 1D labeled array data; best thought of as columnar data\nDataFrame: 2D tabular data with rows and columns\nIndex: A sequence of row/column labels\n\nDataFrames, Series, and Indices can be represented visually in the following diagram.\n\nNotice how the DataFrame is a two dimensional object – it contains both rows and columns. The Series above is a singular column of this DataFrame, namely the Candidate column. Both contain an Index, or a shared list of row labels (the integers from 0 to 5, inclusive).\n\n2.3.1 Series\nA Series represents a column of a DataFrame; more generally, it can be any 1-dimensional array-like object containing values of the same type with associated data labels, called its index.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ns = pd.Series([-1, 10, 2])\nprint(s)\n\n0    -1\n1    10\n2     2\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\ns.array # Data contained within the Series\n\n<PandasArray>\n[-1, 10, 2]\nLength: 3, dtype: int64\n\n\n\ns.index # The Index of the Series\n\nRangeIndex(start=0, stop=3, step=1)\n\n\nBy default, row indices in pandas are a sequential list of integers beginning from 0. Optionally, a list of desired indices can be passed to the index argument.\n\ns = pd.Series([-1, 10, 2], index = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"])\nprint(s)\n\na    -1\nb    10\nc     2\ndtype: int64\n\n\nIndices can also be changed after initialization.\n\ns.index = [\"first\", \"second\", \"third\"]\nprint(s)\n\nfirst     -1\nsecond    10\nthird      2\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n2.3.1.1 Selection in Series\nSimilar to an array, we can select a single value or a set of values from a Series. There are 3 primary methods of selecting data.\n\nA single index label\nA list of index labels\nA filtering condition\n\nLet’s define the following Series ser.\n\nser = pd.Series([4, -2, 0, 6], index = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"])\nprint(ser)\n\na    4\nb   -2\nc    0\nd    6\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n2.3.1.1.1 A Single Index Label\n\nprint(ser[\"a\"]) # Notice how the return value is a single array element\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1.1.2 A List of Index Labels\n\nser[[\"a\", \"c\"]] # Notice how the return value is another Series\n\na    4\nc    0\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1.1.3 A Filtering Condition\nPerhaps the most interesting (and useful) method of selecting data from a Series is with a filtering condition.\nWe first must apply a vectorized boolean operation to our Series that encodes the filter conditon.\n\nser > 0 # Filter condition: select all elements greater than 0\n\na     True\nb    False\nc    False\nd     True\ndtype: bool\n\n\nUpon “indexing” in our Series with this condition, pandas selects only the rows with True values.\n\nser[ser > 0] \n\na    4\nd    6\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 DataFrames\nIn Data 8, you encountered the Table class of the datascience library, which represented tabular data. In Data 100, we’ll be using the DataFrame class of the pandas library.\nHere is an example of a DataFrame that contains election data.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nelections = pd.read_csv(\"data/elections.csv\")\nelections.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Year\n      Candidate\n      Party\n      Popular vote\n      Result\n      %\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1824\n      Andrew Jackson\n      Democratic-Republican\n      151271\n      loss\n      57.210122\n    \n    \n      1\n      1824\n      John Quincy Adams\n      Democratic-Republican\n      113142\n      win\n      42.789878\n    \n    \n      2\n      1828\n      Andrew Jackson\n      Democratic\n      642806\n      win\n      56.203927\n    \n    \n      3\n      1828\n      John Quincy Adams\n      National Republican\n      500897\n      loss\n      43.796073\n    \n    \n      4\n      1832\n      Andrew Jackson\n      Democratic\n      702735\n      win\n      54.574789\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nLet’s dissect the code above.\n\nWe first import the pandas library into our Python environment, using the alias pd.   import pandas as pd\nThere are a number of ways to read data into a DataFrame. In Data 100, our data are typically stored in a CSV (comma-seperated values) file format. We can import a CSV file into a DataFrame by passing the data path as an argument to the following pandas function.   pd.read_csv(\"elections.csv\")\n\nThis code stores our DataFrame object in the elections variable. Upon inspection, our elections DataFrame has 182 rows and 6 columns (Year, Candidate, Party, Popular Vote, Result, %). Each row represents a single record – in our example, a presedential candidate from some particular year. Each column represents a single attribute, or feature of the record.\nIn the example above, we constructed a DataFrame object using data from a CSV file. As we’ll explore in the next section, we can create a DataFrame with data of our own.\n\n2.3.2.1 Creating a DataFrame\nThere are many ways to create a DataFrame. Here, we will cover the most popular approaches.\n\nUsing a list and column names\nFrom a dictionary\nFrom a Series\n\n\n2.3.2.1.1 Using a List and Column Names\nConsider the following examples.\n\ndf_list = pd.DataFrame([1, 2, 3], columns=[\"Numbers\"])\ndf_list\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Numbers\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe first code cell creates a DataFrame with a single column Numbers, while the second creates a DataFrame with an additional column Description. Notice how a 2D list of values is required to initialize the second DataFrame – each nested list represents a single row of data.\n\ndf_list = pd.DataFrame([[1, \"one\"], [2, \"two\"]], columns = [\"Number\", \"Description\"])\ndf_list\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Number\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      one\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      two\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2.1.2 From a Dictionary\nA second (and more common) way to create a DataFrame is with a dictionary. The dictionary keys represent the column names, and the dictionary values represent the column values.\n\ndf_dict = pd.DataFrame({\"Fruit\": [\"Strawberry\", \"Orange\"], \"Price\": [5.49, 3.99]})\ndf_dict\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Fruit\n      Price\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Strawberry\n      5.49\n    \n    \n      1\n      Orange\n      3.99\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2.1.3 From a Series\nEarlier, we explained how a Series was synonymous to a column in a DataFrame. It follows then, that a DataFrame is equivalent to a collection of Series, which all share the same index.\nIn fact, we can initialize a DataFrame by merging two or more Series.\n\n# Notice how our indices, or row labels, are the same\n\ns_a = pd.Series([\"a1\", \"a2\", \"a3\"], index = [\"r1\", \"r2\", \"r3\"])\ns_b = pd.Series([\"b1\", \"b2\", \"b3\"], index = [\"r1\", \"r2\", \"r3\"])\n\npd.DataFrame({\"A-column\": s_a, \"B-column\": s_b})\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      A-column\n      B-column\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      r1\n      a1\n      b1\n    \n    \n      r2\n      a2\n      b2\n    \n    \n      r3\n      a3\n      b3\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Indices\nThe major takeaway: we can think of a DataFrame as a collection of Series that all share the same Index.\nOn a more technical note, an Index doesn’t have to be an integer, nor does it have to be unique. For example, we can set the index of the elections Dataframe to be the name of presedential candidates. Selecting a new Series from this modified DataFrame yields the following.\n\n# This sets the index to the \"Candidate\" column\nelections.set_index(\"Candidate\", inplace=True)\n\n\nTo retrieve the indices of a DataFrame, simply use the .index attribute of the DataFrame class.\n\nelections.head().index\n\nIndex(['Andrew Jackson', 'John Quincy Adams', 'Andrew Jackson',\n       'John Quincy Adams', 'Andrew Jackson'],\n      dtype='object', name='Candidate')\n\n\n\n# This resets the index to be the default list of integers\nelections.reset_index(inplace=True)"

    "section": "2.4 Slicing in DataFrames",
    "text": "2.4 Slicing in DataFrames\nNow that we’ve learned how to create DataFrames, let’s dive deeper into their capabilities.\nThe API (application programming interface) for the DataFrame class is enormous. In this section, we’ll discuss several methods of the DataFrame API that allow us to extract subsets of data.\nThe simplest way to manipulate a DataFrame is to extract a subset of rows and columns, known as slicing. We will do so with three primary methods of the DataFrame class:\n\n.loc\n.iloc\n[]\n\n\n2.4.1 Indexing with .loc\nThe .loc operator selects rows and columns in a DataFrame by their row and column label(s), respectively. The row labels (commonly referred to as the indices) are the bold text on the far left of a DataFrame, while the column labels are the column names found at the top of a DataFrame.\nTo grab data with .loc, we must specify the row and column label(s) where the data exists. The row labels are the first argument to the .loc function; the column labels are the second. For example, we can select the the row labeled 0 and the column labeled Candidate from the elections DataFrame.\n\nelections.loc[0, 'Candidate']\n\n'Andrew Jackson'\n\n\nTo select multiple rows and columns, we can use Python slice notation. Here, we select both the first four rows and columns.\n\nelections.loc[0:3, 'Year':'Popular vote']\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Year\n      Party\n      Popular vote\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1824\n      Democratic-Republican\n      151271\n    \n    \n      1\n      1824\n      Democratic-Republican\n      113142\n    \n    \n      2\n      1828\n      Democratic\n      642806\n    \n    \n      3\n      1828\n      National Republican\n      500897\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nSuppose that instead, we wanted every column value for the first four rows in the elections DataFrame. The shorthand : is useful for this.\n\nelections.loc[0:3, :]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Candidate\n      Year\n      Party\n      Popular vote\n      Result\n      %\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Andrew Jackson\n      1824\n      Democratic-Republican\n      151271\n      loss\n      57.210122\n    \n    \n      1\n      John Quincy Adams\n      1824\n      Democratic-Republican\n      113142\n      win\n      42.789878\n    \n    \n      2\n      Andrew Jackson\n      1828\n      Democratic\n      642806\n      win\n      56.203927\n    \n    \n      3\n      John Quincy Adams\n      1828\n      National Republican\n      500897\n      loss\n      43.796073\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of things we should note. Unlike conventional Python, Pandas allows us to slice string values (in our example, the column labels). Secondly, slicing with .loc is inclusive. Notice how our resulting DataFrame includes every row and column between and including the slice labels we specified.\nEquivalently, we can use a list to obtain multiple rows and columns in our elections DataFrame.\n\nelections.loc[[0, 1, 2, 3], ['Year', 'Candidate', 'Party', 'Popular vote']]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Year\n      Candidate\n      Party\n      Popular vote\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1824\n      Andrew Jackson\n      Democratic-Republican\n      151271\n    \n    \n      1\n      1824\n      John Quincy Adams\n      Democratic-Republican\n      113142\n    \n    \n      2\n      1828\n      Andrew Jackson\n      Democratic\n      642806\n    \n    \n      3\n      1828\n      John Quincy Adams\n      National Republican\n      500897\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nLastly, we can interchange list and slicing notation.\n\nelections.loc[[0, 1, 2, 3], :]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Candidate\n      Year\n      Party\n      Popular vote\n      Result\n      %\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Andrew Jackson\n      1824\n      Democratic-Republican\n      151271\n      loss\n      57.210122\n    \n    \n      1\n      John Quincy Adams\n      1824\n      Democratic-Republican\n      113142\n      win\n      42.789878\n    \n    \n      2\n      Andrew Jackson\n      1828\n      Democratic\n      642806\n      win\n      56.203927\n    \n    \n      3\n      John Quincy Adams\n      1828\n      National Republican\n      500897\n      loss\n      43.796073\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Indexing with .iloc\nSlicing with .iloc works similarily to .loc, although .iloc uses the integer positions of rows and columns rather the labels. The arguments to the .iloc function also behave similarly - single values, lists, indices, and any combination of these are permitted.\nLet’s begin reproducing our results from above. We’ll begin by selecting for the first presedential candidate in our elections DataFrame:\n\n# elections.loc[0, \"Candidate\"] - Previous approach\nelections.iloc[0, 1]\n\n1824\n\n\nNotice how the first argument to both .loc and .iloc are the same. This is because the row with a label of 0 is conveniently in the 0th (or first) position of the elections DataFrame. Generally, this is true of any DataFrame where the row labels are incremented in ascending order from 0.\nHowever, when we select the first four rows and columns using .iloc, we notice something.\n\n# elections.loc[0:3, 'Year':'Popular vote'] - Previous approach\nelections.iloc[0:4, 0:4]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Candidate\n      Year\n      Party\n      Popular vote\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Andrew Jackson\n      1824\n      Democratic-Republican\n      151271\n    \n    \n      1\n      John Quincy Adams\n      1824\n      Democratic-Republican\n      113142\n    \n    \n      2\n      Andrew Jackson\n      1828\n      Democratic\n      642806\n    \n    \n      3\n      John Quincy Adams\n      1828\n      National Republican\n      500897\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nSlicing is no longer inclusive in .iloc - it’s exclusive. This is one of Pandas syntatical subtleties; you’ll get used to with practice.\nList behavior works just as expected.\n\n#elections.loc[[0, 1, 2, 3], ['Year', 'Candidate', 'Party', 'Popular vote']] - Previous Approach\nelections.iloc[[0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 3]]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Candidate\n      Year\n      Party\n      Popular vote\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Andrew Jackson\n      1824\n      Democratic-Republican\n      151271\n    \n    \n      1\n      John Quincy Adams\n      1824\n      Democratic-Republican\n      113142\n    \n    \n      2\n      Andrew Jackson\n      1828\n      Democratic\n      642806\n    \n    \n      3\n      John Quincy Adams\n      1828\n      National Republican\n      500897\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nThis discussion begs the question: when should we use .loc vs .iloc? In most cases, .loc is generally safer to use. You can imagine .iloc may return incorrect values when applied to a dataset where the ordering of data can change.\n\n\n2.4.3 Indexing with []\nThe [] selection operator is the most baffling of all, yet the commonly used. It only takes a single argument, which may be one of the following:\n\nA slice of row numbers\nA list of column labels\nA single column label\n\nThat is, [] is context dependent. Let’s see some examples.\n\n2.4.3.1 A slice of row numbers\nSay we wanted the first four rows of our elections DataFrame.\n\nelections[0:4]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Candidate\n      Year\n      Party\n      Popular vote\n      Result\n      %\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Andrew Jackson\n      1824\n      Democratic-Republican\n      151271\n      loss\n      57.210122\n    \n    \n      1\n      John Quincy Adams\n      1824\n      Democratic-Republican\n      113142\n      win\n      42.789878\n    \n    \n      2\n      Andrew Jackson\n      1828\n      Democratic\n      642806\n      win\n      56.203927\n    \n    \n      3\n      John Quincy Adams\n      1828\n      National Republican\n      500897\n      loss\n      43.796073\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3.2 A list of column labels\nSuppose we now want the first four columns.\n\nelections[[\"Year\", \"Candidate\", \"Party\", \"Popular vote\"]].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Year\n      Candidate\n      Party\n      Popular vote\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1824\n      Andrew Jackson\n      Democratic-Republican\n      151271\n    \n    \n      1\n      1824\n      John Quincy Adams\n      Democratic-Republican\n      113142\n    \n    \n      2\n      1828\n      Andrew Jackson\n      Democratic\n      642806\n    \n    \n      3\n      1828\n      John Quincy Adams\n      National Republican\n      500897\n    \n    \n      4\n      1832\n      Andrew Jackson\n      Democratic\n      702735\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3.3 A single column label\nLastly, if we only want the Candidate column.\n\nelections[\"Candidate\"].head()\n\n0       Andrew Jackson\n1    John Quincy Adams\n2       Andrew Jackson\n3    John Quincy Adams\n4       Andrew Jackson\nName: Candidate, dtype: object\n\n\nThe output looks like a Series! In this course, we’ll become very comfortable with [], especially for selecting columns. In practice, [] is much more common than .loc."

    "section": "3.1 Conditional Selection",
    "text": "3.1 Conditional Selection\nConditional selection allows us to select a subset of rows in a DataFrame if they follow some specified condition.\nTo understand how to use conditional selection, we must look at another possible input of the .loc and [] methods – a boolean array, which is simply an array where each element is either True or False. This boolean array must have a length equal to the number of rows in the DataFrame. It will return all rows in the position of a corresponding True value in the array.\nTo see this in action, let’s select all even-indexed rows in the first 10 rows of our DataFrame.\n\n# Ask yourself: why is :9 is the correct slice to select the first 10 rows?\nbabynames_first_10_rows = babynames.loc[:9, :]\n\n# Notice how we have exactly 10 elements in our boolean array argument\nbabynames_first_10_rows[[True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False]]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      State\n      Sex\n      Year\n      Name\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Mary\n      295\n    \n    \n      2\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Dorothy\n      220\n    \n    \n      4\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Frances\n      134\n    \n    \n      6\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Evelyn\n      126\n    \n    \n      8\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Virginia\n      101\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe can perform a similar operation using .loc.\n\nbabynames_first_10_rows.loc[[True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False], :]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      State\n      Sex\n      Year\n      Name\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Mary\n      295\n    \n    \n      2\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Dorothy\n      220\n    \n    \n      4\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Frances\n      134\n    \n    \n      6\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Evelyn\n      126\n    \n    \n      8\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Virginia\n      101\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nThese techniques worked well in this example, but you can imagine how tedious it might be to list out Trues and Falses for every row in a larger DataFrame. To make things easier, we can instead provide a logical condition as an input to .loc or [] that returns a boolean array with the necessary length.\nFor example, to return all names associated with F sex:\n\n# First, use a logical condition to generate a boolean array\nlogical_operator = (babynames[\"Sex\"] == \"F\")\n\n# Then, use this boolean array to filter the DataFrame\nbabynames[logical_operator].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      State\n      Sex\n      Year\n      Name\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Mary\n      295\n    \n    \n      1\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Helen\n      239\n    \n    \n      2\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Dorothy\n      220\n    \n    \n      3\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Margaret\n      163\n    \n    \n      4\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Frances\n      134\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nHere, logical_operator evaluates to a Series of boolean values with length 400762.\n\nprint(\"There are a total of {} values in 'logical_operator'\".format(len(logical_operator)))\n\nThere are a total of 400762 values in 'logical_operator'\n\n\nRows starting at row 0 and ending at row 235790 evaluate to True and are thus returned in the DataFrame.\n\n\nCode\nprint(\"The 0th item in this 'logical_operator' is: {}\".format(logical_operator.iloc[0]))\nprint(\"The 235790th item in this 'logical_operator' is: {}\".format(logical_operator.iloc[235790]))\nprint(\"The 235791th item in this 'logical_operator' is: {}\".format(logical_operator.iloc[235791]))\n\n\nThe 0th item in this 'logical_operator' is: True\nThe 235790th item in this 'logical_operator' is: True\nThe 235791th item in this 'logical_operator' is: False\n\n\nPassing a Series as an argument to babynames[] has the same affect as using a boolean array. In fact, the [] selection operator can take a boolean Series, array, and list as arguments. These three are used interchangeably thoughout the course.\nWe can also use .loc to achieve similar results.\n\nbabynames.loc[babynames[\"Sex\"] == \"F\"].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      State\n      Sex\n      Year\n      Name\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Mary\n      295\n    \n    \n      1\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Helen\n      239\n    \n    \n      2\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Dorothy\n      220\n    \n    \n      3\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Margaret\n      163\n    \n    \n      4\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Frances\n      134\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nBoolean conditions can be combined using various operators that allow us to filter results by multiple conditions. Some examples include the & (and) operator and the | (or) operator.\nNote: When combining multiple conditions with logical operators, be sure to surround each condition with a set of parenthesis (). If you forget, your code will throw an error.\nFor example, if we want to return data on all females born before the 21st century, we can write:\n\nbabynames[(babynames[\"Sex\"] == \"F\") & (babynames[\"Year\"] < 2000)].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      State\n      Sex\n      Year\n      Name\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Mary\n      295\n    \n    \n      1\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Helen\n      239\n    \n    \n      2\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Dorothy\n      220\n    \n    \n      3\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Margaret\n      163\n    \n    \n      4\n      CA\n      F\n      1910\n      Frances\n      134\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nBoolean array selection is a useful tool, but can lead to overly verbose code for complex conditions. Pandas provide many alternatives:\n\n(\n    babynames[(babynames[\"Name\"] == \"Bella\") | \n              (babynames[\"Name\"] == \"Alex\") |\n              (babynames[\"Name\"] == \"Ani\") |\n              (babynames[\"Name\"] == \"Lisa\")]\n).head()\n# Note: The parentheses surrounding the code make it possible to break the code on to multiple lines for readability\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      State\n      Sex\n      Year\n      Name\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      6289\n      CA\n      F\n      1923\n      Bella\n      5\n    \n    \n      7512\n      CA\n      F\n      1925\n      Bella\n      8\n    \n    \n      12368\n      CA\n      F\n      1932\n      Lisa\n      5\n    \n    \n      14741\n      CA\n      F\n      1936\n      Lisa\n      8\n    \n    \n      17084\n      CA\n      F\n      1939\n      Lisa\n      5\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe .isin function can be used to filter dataframes.

Calling these dimension-finding functions is much faster than counting all of the items by hand.\n\nbabynames.shape\n\n(400762, 5)\n\n\n\nbabynames.size\n\n2003810\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 .describe()\nIf many statistics are required from a DataFrame (minimum value, maximum value, mean value, etc.), then .describe() can be used to compute all of them at once.\n\nbabynames.describe()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Year\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      count\n      400762.000000\n      400762.000000\n    \n    \n      mean\n      1985.131287\n      79.953781\n    \n    \n      std\n      26.821004\n      295.414618\n    \n    \n      min\n      1910.000000\n      5.000000\n    \n    \n      25%\n      1968.000000\n      7.000000\n    \n    \n      50%\n      1991.000000\n      13.000000\n    \n    \n      75%\n      2007.000000\n      38.000000\n    \n    \n      max\n      2021.000000\n      8262.000000\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nA different set of statistics will be reported if .describe() is called on a Series.\n\nbabynames[\"Sex\"].describe()\n\ncount     400762\nunique         2\ntop            F\nfreq      235791\nName: Sex, dtype: object\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 .sample()\nAs we will see later in the semester, random processes are at the heart of many data science techniques (for example, train-test splits, bootstrapping, and cross-validation). .sample() lets us quickly select random entries (a row if called from a DataFrame, or a value if called from a Series).\n\nbabynames.sample()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      State\n      Sex\n      Year\n      Name\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      243767\n      CA\n      M\n      1928\n      Morris\n      25\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nbabynames.sample(5).iloc[:, 2:]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Year\n      Name\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      84375\n      1980\n      Steven\n      15\n    \n    \n      385820\n      2016\n      Tiberius\n      7\n    \n    \n      145780\n      1999\n      Eileen\n      132\n    \n    \n      96702\n      1984\n      Tomasa\n      5\n    \n    \n      159330\n      2002\n      Fatimah\n      7\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nbabynames[babynames[\"Year\"] == 2000].sample(4, replace = True).iloc[:, 2:]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Year\n      Name\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      340342\n      2000\n      Khari\n      8\n    \n    \n      152091\n      2000\n      Kareen\n      6\n    \n    \n      151523\n      2000\n      Joleen\n      8\n    \n    \n      149619\n      2000\n      Lena\n      64\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5 .value_counts()\nWhen we want to know the distribution of the items in a Series (for example, what items are most/least common), we use .value-counts() to get a breakdown of the unique values and their counts. In the example below, we can determine the name with the most years in which at least one person has taken that name by counting the number of times each name appears in the \"Name\" column of babynames.\n\nbabynames[\"Name\"].value_counts().head()\n\nJean         221\nFrancis      219\nGuadalupe    216\nJessie       215\nMarion       213\nName: Name, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\n3.2.6 .unique()\nIf we have a Series with many repeated values, then .unique() can be used to identify only the unique values. Here we can get a list of all the names in babynames.\nExercise: what function can we call on the Series below to get the number of unique names?\n\nbabynames[\"Name\"].unique()\n\narray(['Mary', 'Helen', 'Dorothy', ..., 'Zyire', 'Zylo', 'Zyrus'],\n      dtype=object)\n\n\n\n\n3.2.7 .sort_values()\nOrdering a DataFrame can be useful for isolating extreme values. For example, the first 5 entries of a row sorted in descending order (that is, from highest to lowest) are the largest 5 values. .sort_values allows us to order a DataFrame or Series by a specified rule. For DataFrames, we must specify the column by which we want to compare the rows and the function will return such rows. We can choose to either receive the rows in ascending order (default) or descending order.\n\nbabynames.sort_values(by = \"Count\", ascending=False).head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      State\n      Sex\n      Year\n      Name\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      263272\n      CA\n      M\n      1956\n      Michael\n      8262\n    \n    \n      264297\n      CA\n      M\n      1957\n      Michael\n      8250\n    \n    \n      313644\n      CA\n      M\n      1990\n      Michael\n      8247\n    \n    \n      278109\n      CA\n      M\n      1969\n      Michael\n      8244\n    \n    \n      279405\n      CA\n      M\n      1970\n      Michael\n      8197\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe do not need to explicitly specify the column used for sorting when calling .value_counts() on a Series. We can still specify the ordering paradigm – that is, whether values are sorted in ascending or descending order.\n\nbabynames[\"Name\"].sort_values(ascending=True).head()\n\n380256      Aadan\n362255      Aadan\n365374      Aadan\n394460    Aadarsh\n366561      Aaden\nName: Name, dtype: object\n\n\n\n3.2.7.1 Sorting With a Custom Key\nUsing .sort_values can be useful in many situations, but it many not cover all use cases. This is because pandas automatically sorts values in order according to numeric value (for number data) or alphabetical order (for string data). The following code finds the top 5 most popular names in California in 2021.\n\n# Sort names by count in year 2021\n# Recall that `.head(5)` displays the first five rows in the DataFrame\nbabynames[babynames[\"Year\"] == 2021].sort_values(\"Count\", ascending=False).head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      State\n      Sex\n      Year\n      Name\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      397909\n      CA\n      M\n      2021\n      Noah\n      2591\n    \n    \n      397910\n      CA\n      M\n      2021\n      Liam\n      2469\n    \n    \n      232145\n      CA\n      F\n      2021\n      Olivia\n      2395\n    \n    \n      232146\n      CA\n      F\n      2021\n      Emma\n      2171\n    \n    \n      397911\n      CA\n      M\n      2021\n      Mateo\n      2108\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nThis offers us a lot of functionality, but what if we need to sort by some other metric? For example, what if we wanted to find the longest names in the DataFrame?\nWe can do this by specifying the key parameter of .sort_values. The key parameter is assigned to a function of our choice. This function is then applied to each value in the specified column. pandas will, finally, sort the DataFrame by the values outputted by the function.\n\n# Here, a lambda function is applied to find the length of each value, `x`, in the \"Name\" column\nbabynames.sort_values(\"Name\", key=lambda x: x.str.len(), ascending=False).head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      State\n      Sex\n      Year\n      Name\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      313143\n      CA\n      M\n      1989\n      Franciscojavier\n      6\n    \n    \n      333732\n      CA\n      M\n      1997\n      Ryanchristopher\n      5\n    \n    \n      330421\n      CA\n      M\n      1996\n      Franciscojavier\n      8\n    \n    \n      323615\n      CA\n      M\n      1993\n      Johnchristopher\n      5\n    \n    \n      310235\n      CA\n      M\n      1988\n      Franciscojavier\n      10"

    "text": "3.4 Aggregating Data with GroupBy\nUp until this point, we have been working with individual rows of DataFrames. As data scientists, we often wish to investigate trends across a larger subset of our data. For example, we may want to compute some summary statistic (the mean, median, sum, etc.) for a group of rows in our DataFrame. To do this, we’ll use pandas GroupBy objects.\nLet’s say we wanted to aggregate all rows in babynames for a given year.\n\nbabynames.groupby(\"Year\")\n\n<pandas.core.groupby.generic.DataFrameGroupBy object at 0x11cc69b20>\n\n\nWhat does this strange output mean? Calling .groupby has generated a GroupBy object. You can imagine this as a set of “mini” sub-DataFrames, where each subframe contains all of the rows from babynames that correspond to a particular year.\nThe diagram below shows a simplified view of babynames to help illustrate this idea.\n\n\n\nCreating a GroupBy object\n\n\nWe can’t work with a GroupBy object directly – that is why you saw that strange output earlier, rather than a standard view of a DataFrame. To actually manipulate values within these “mini” DataFrames, we’ll need to call an aggregation method. This is a method that tells pandas how to aggregate the values within the GroupBy object. Once the aggregation is applied, pandas will return a normal (now grouped) DataFrame.\nThe first aggregation method we’ll consider is .agg. The .agg method takes in a function as its argument; this function is then applied to each column of a “mini” grouped DataFrame. We end up with a new DataFrame with one aggregated row per subframe. Let’s see this in action by finding the sum of all counts for each year in babynames – this is equivalent to finding the number of babies born in each year.\n\nbabynames.groupby(\"Year\").agg(sum).head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Count\n    \n    \n      Year\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1910\n      9163\n    \n    \n      1911\n      9983\n    \n    \n      1912\n      17946\n    \n    \n      1913\n      22094\n    \n    \n      1914\n      26926\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe can relate this back to the diagram we used above. Remember that the diagram uses a simplified version of babynames, which is why we see smaller values for the summed counts.\n\n\n\nPerforming an aggregation\n\n\nCalling .agg has condensed each subframe back into a single row. This gives us our final output: a DataFrame that is now indexed by \"Year\", with a single row for each unique year in the original babynames DataFrame.\nYou may be wondering: where did the \"State\", \"Sex\", and \"Name\" columns go? Logically, it doesn’t make sense to sum the string data in these columns (how would we add “Mary” + “Ann”?). Because of this, pandas will simply omit these columns when it performs the aggregation on the DataFrame. Since this happens implicitly, without the user specifying that these columns should be ignored, it’s easy to run into troubling situations where columns are removed without the programmer noticing. It is better coding practice to select only the columns we care about before performing the aggregation.\n\n# Same result, but now we explicitly tell Pandas to only consider the \"Count\" column when summing\nbabynames.groupby(\"Year\")[[\"Count\"]].agg(sum).head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Count\n    \n    \n      Year\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1910\n      9163\n    \n    \n      1911\n      9983\n    \n    \n      1912\n      17946\n    \n    \n      1913\n      22094\n    \n    \n      1914\n      26926\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Parting note\nManipulating DataFrames is a skill that is not mastered in just one day. Due to the flexibility of pandas, there are many different ways to get from a point A to a point B. We recommend trying multiple different ways to solve the same problem to gain even more practice and reach that point of mastery sooner.\nNext, we will start digging deeper into the mechanics behind grouping data."

The input parameter x to the lambda function is a GroupBy object. Therefore, it should make sense why lambda x : x.iloc[0] selects the first row in each groupby object.\nIn fact, there’s a few different ways to approach this problem. Each approach has different tradeoffs in terms of readability, performance, memory consumption, complexity, etc. We’ve given a few examples below.\nNote: Understanding these alternative solutions is not required. They are given to demonstrate the vast number of problem-solving approaches in pandas.\n\n# Using the idxmax function\nbest_per_party = elections.loc[elections.groupby('Party')['%'].idxmax()]\nbest_per_party.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Year\n      Candidate\n      Party\n      Popular vote\n      Result\n      %\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      22\n      1856\n      Millard Fillmore\n      American\n      873053\n      loss\n      21.554001\n    \n    \n      115\n      1968\n      George Wallace\n      American Independent\n      9901118\n      loss\n      13.571218\n    \n    \n      6\n      1832\n      William Wirt\n      Anti-Masonic\n      100715\n      loss\n      7.821583\n    \n    \n      38\n      1884\n      Benjamin Butler\n      Anti-Monopoly\n      134294\n      loss\n      1.335838\n    \n    \n      127\n      1980\n      Barry Commoner\n      Citizens\n      233052\n      loss\n      0.270182\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n# Using the .drop_duplicates function\nbest_per_party2 = elections.sort_values('%').drop_duplicates(['Party'], keep='last')\nbest_per_party2.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Year\n      Candidate\n      Party\n      Popular vote\n      Result\n      %\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      148\n      1996\n      John Hagelin\n      Natural Law\n      113670\n      loss\n      0.118219\n    \n    \n      164\n      2008\n      Chuck Baldwin\n      Constitution\n      199750\n      loss\n      0.152398\n    \n    \n      110\n      1956\n      T.

Some useful options are:\n\n.max: creates a new DataFrame with the maximum value of each group\n.mean: creates a new DataFrame with the mean value of each group\n.size: creates a new Series with the number of entries in each group\n\nIn fact, these (and other) aggregation functions are so common that pandas allows for writing shorthand. Instead of explicitly stating the use of .agg, we can call the function directly on the GroupBy object.\nFor example, the following are equivalent:\n\nelections.groupby(\"Candidate\").agg(mean)\nelections.groupby(\"Candidate\").mean()\n\n\n\n4.2.3 The groupby.filter() function\nAnother common use for GroupBy objects is to filter data by group.\ngroupby.filter takes an argument \\(\\text{f}\\), where \\(\\text{f}\\) is a function that:\n\nTakes a GroupBy object as input\nReturns a single True or False for the entire subframe\n\nGroupBy objects that correspond to True are returned in the final result, whereas those with a False value are not. Importantly, groupby.filter is different from groupby.agg in that the entire subframe is returned in the final DataFrame, not just a single row.\nTo illustrate how this happens, consider the following .filter function applied on some arbitrary data. Say we want to identify “tight” election years – that is, we want to find all rows that correspond to elections years where all candidates in that year won a similar portion of the total vote. Specifically, let’s find all rows corresponding to a year where no candidate won more than 45% of the total vote.\nAn equivalent way of framing this goal is to say:\n\nFind the years where the maximum % in that year is less than 45%\nReturn all DataFrame rows that correspond to these years\n\nFor each year, we need to find the maximum % among all rows for that year. If this maximum % is lower than 45%, we will tell pandas to keep all rows corresponding to that year.\n\nelections.groupby(\"Year\").filter(lambda sf: sf[\"%\"].max() < 45).head(9)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Year\n      Candidate\n      Party\n      Popular vote\n      Result\n      %\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      23\n      1860\n      Abraham Lincoln\n      Republican\n      1855993\n      win\n      39.699408\n    \n    \n      24\n      1860\n      John Bell\n      Constitutional Union\n      590901\n      loss\n      12.639283\n    \n    \n      25\n      1860\n      John C.

In this example, we’ve defined our filtering function, \\(\\text{f}\\), to be lambda sf: sf[\"%\"].max() < 45. This filtering function will find the maximum \"%\" value among all entries in the grouped subframe, which we call sf. If the maximum value is less than 45, then the filter function will return True and all rows in that grouped subframe will appear in the final output DataFrame.\nExamine the DataFrame above. Notice how, in this preview of the first 9 rows, all entries from the years 1860 and 1912 appear. This means that in 1860 and 1912, no candidate in that year won more than 45% of the total vote.\nYou may ask: how is the groupby.filter procedure different to the boolean filtering we’ve seen previously? Boolean filtering considers individual rows when applying a boolean condition. For example, the code elections[elections[\"%\"] < 45] will check the \"%\" value of every single row in elections; if it is less than 45, then that row will be kept in the output. groupby.filter, in contrast, applies a boolean condition across all rows in a group. If not all rows in that group satisfy the condition specified by the filter, the entire group will be discarded in the output."

To do this, we’ll group by both the \"Year\" and \"Sex\" columns.\n\n\nCode\nimport urllib.request\nimport os.path\n\n# Download data from the web directly\ndata_url = \"https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip\"\nlocal_filename = \"data/babynames.zip\"\nif not os.path.exists(local_filename): # if the data exists don't download again\n    with urllib.request.urlopen(data_url) as resp, open(local_filename, 'wb') as f:\n        f.write(resp.read())\n\n        \n# Load data without unzipping the file\nimport zipfile\nbabynames = [] \nwith zipfile.ZipFile(local_filename, \"r\") as zf:\n    data_files = [f for f in zf.filelist if f.filename[-3:] == \"txt\"]\n    def extract_year_from_filename(fn):\n        return int(fn[3:7])\n    for f in data_files:\n        year = extract_year_from_filename(f.filename)\n        with zf.open(f) as fp:\n            df = pd.read_csv(fp, names=[\"Name\", \"Sex\", \"Count\"])\n            df[\"Year\"] = year\n            babynames.append(df)\nbabynames = pd.concat(babynames)\n\n\n\nbabynames.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Name\n      Sex\n      Count\n      Year\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Mary\n      F\n      7065\n      1880\n    \n    \n      1\n      Anna\n      F\n      2604\n      1880\n    \n    \n      2\n      Emma\n      F\n      2003\n      1880\n    \n    \n      3\n      Elizabeth\n      F\n      1939\n      1880\n    \n    \n      4\n      Minnie\n      F\n      1746\n      1880\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n# Find the total number of baby names associated with each sex for each year in the data\nbabynames.groupby([\"Year\", \"Sex\"])[[\"Count\"]].agg(sum).head(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      Count\n    \n    \n      Year\n      Sex\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1880\n      F\n      90994\n    \n    \n      M\n      110490\n    \n    \n      1881\n      F\n      91953\n    \n    \n      M\n      100737\n    \n    \n      1882\n      F\n      107847\n    \n    \n      M\n      113686\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nNotice that both \"Year\" and \"Sex\" serve as the index of the DataFrame (they are both rendered in bold). We’ve created a multindex where two different index values, the year and sex, are used to uniquely identify each row.\nThis isn’t the most intuitive way of representing this data – and, because multindexes have multiple dimensions in their index, they can often be difficult to use.\nAnother strategy to aggregate across two columns is to create a pivot table. You saw these back in Data 8. One set of values is used to create the index of the table; another set is used to define the column names. The values contained in each cell of the table correspond to the aggregated data for each index-column pair.\nThe best way to understand pivot tables is to see one in action. Let’s return to our original goal of summing the total number of names associated with each combination of year and sex. We’ll call the pandas .pivot_table method to create a new table.\n\n# The `pivot_table` method is used to generate a Pandas pivot table\nimport numpy as np\nbabynames.pivot_table(index = \"Year\", columns = \"Sex\", values = \"Count\", aggfunc = np.sum).head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Sex\n      F\n      M\n    \n    \n      Year\n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1880\n      90994\n      110490\n    \n    \n      1881\n      91953\n      100737\n    \n    \n      1882\n      107847\n      113686\n    \n    \n      1883\n      112319\n      104625\n    \n    \n      1884\n      129019\n      114442\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nLooks a lot better! Now, our DataFrame is structured with clear index-column combinations. Each entry in the pivot table represents the summed count of names for a given combination of \"Year\" and \"Sex\".\nLet’s take a closer look at the code implemented above.\n\nindex = \"Year\" specifies the column name in the original DataFrame that should be used as the index of the pivot table\ncolumns = \"Sex\" specifies the column name in the original DataFrame that should be used to generate the columns of the pivot table\nvalues = \"Count\" indicates what values from the original DataFrame should be used to populate the entry for each index-column combination\naggfunc = np.sum tells pandas what function to use when aggregating the data specified by values. Here, we are summing the name counts for each pair of \"Year\" and \"Sex\"\n\nWe can even include multiple values in the index or columns of our pivot tables.\n\nbabynames_pivot = babynames.pivot_table(\n    index=\"Year\",     # the rows (turned into index)\n    columns=\"Sex\",    # the column values\n    values=[\"Count\", \"Name\"], \n    aggfunc=max,   # group operation\n)\nbabynames_pivot.head(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Count\n      Name\n    \n    \n      Sex\n      F\n      M\n      F\n      M\n    \n    \n      Year\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1880\n      7065\n      9655\n      Zula\n      Zeke\n    \n    \n      1881\n      6919\n      8769\n      Zula\n      Zeb\n    \n    \n      1882\n      8148\n      9557\n      Zula\n      Zed\n    \n    \n      1883\n      8012\n      8894\n      Zula\n      Zeno\n    \n    \n      1884\n      9217\n      9388\n      Zula\n      Zollie\n    \n    \n      1885\n      9128\n      8756\n      Zula\n      Zollie"

    "text": "5.1 Structure\n\n5.1.1 File Format\nIn the past two pandas lectures, we briefly touched on the idea of file format: the way data is encoded in a file for storage. Specifically, our elections and babynames datasets were stored and loaded as CSVs:\n\nimport pandas as pd\npd.read_csv(\"data/elections.csv\").head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Year\n      Candidate\n      Party\n      Popular vote\n      Result\n      %\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1824\n      Andrew Jackson\n      Democratic-Republican\n      151271\n      loss\n      57.210122\n    \n    \n      1\n      1824\n      John Quincy Adams\n      Democratic-Republican\n      113142\n      win\n      42.789878\n    \n    \n      2\n      1828\n      Andrew Jackson\n      Democratic\n      642806\n      win\n      56.203927\n    \n    \n      3\n      1828\n      John Quincy Adams\n      National Republican\n      500897\n      loss\n      43.796073\n    \n    \n      4\n      1832\n      Andrew Jackson\n      Democratic\n      702735\n      win\n      54.574789\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nCSVs, which stand for Comma-Separated Values, are a common tabular data format. To better understand the properties of a CSV, let’s take a look at the first few rows of the raw data file to see what it looks like before being loaded into a DataFrame.\n\n\nYear,Candidate,Party,Popular vote,Result,%\n\n1824,Andrew Jackson,Democratic-Republican,151271,loss,57.21012204\n\n1824,John Quincy Adams,Democratic-Republican,113142,win,42.78987796\n\n1828,Andrew Jackson,Democratic,642806,win,56.20392707\n\n\n\nEach row, or record, in the data is delimited by a newline. Each column, or field, in the data is delimited by a comma (hence, comma-separated!).\nAnother common file type is the TSV (Tab-Separated Values). In a TSV, records are still delimited by a newline, while fields are delimited by \\t tab character. A TSV can be loaded into pandas using pd.read_csv() with the delimiter parameter: pd.read_csv(\"file_name.tsv\", delimiter=\"\\t\"). A raw TSV file is shown below.\n\n\n﻿Year   Candidate   Party   Popular vote    Result  %\n\n1824    Andrew Jackson  Democratic-Republican   151271  loss    57.21012204\n\n1824    John Quincy Adams   Democratic-Republican   113142  win 42.78987796\n\n1828    Andrew Jackson  Democratic  642806  win 56.20392707\n\n\n\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files behave similarly to Python dictionaries. They can be loaded into pandas using pd.read_json. A raw JSON is shown below.\n\n\n[\n\n {\n\n   \"Year\": 1824,\n\n   \"Candidate\": \"Andrew Jackson\",\n\n   \"Party\": \"Democratic-Republican\",\n\n   \"Popular vote\": 151271,\n\n   \"Result\": \"loss\",\n\n   \"%\": 57.21012204\n\n },\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Variable Types\nAfter loading data into a file, it’s a good idea to take the time to understand what pieces of information are encoded in the dataset. In particular, we want to identify what variable types are present in our data. Broadly speaking, we can categorize variables into one of two overarching types.\nQuantitative variables describe some numeric quantity or amount. We can sub-divide quantitative data into:\n\nContinuous quantitative variables: numeric data that can be measured on a continuous scale to arbitrary precision. Continuous variables do not have a strict set of possible values – they can be recorded to any number of decimal places. For example, weights, GPA, or CO2 concentrations\nDiscrete quantitative variables: numeric data that can only take on a finite set of possible values. For example, someone’s age or number of siblings.\n\nQualitative variables, also known as categorical variables, describe data that isn’t measuring some quantity or amount. The sub-categories of categorical data are:\n\nOrdinal qualitative variables: categories with ordered levels. Specifically, ordinal variables are those where the difference between levels has no consistent, quantifiable meaning. For example, a Yelp rating or set of income brackets.\nNominal qualitative variables: categories with no specific order. For example, someone’s political affiliation or Cal ID number.\n\n\n\n\nClassification of variable types\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Primary and Foreign Keys\nLast time, we introduced .merge as the pandas method for joining multiple DataFrames together. In our discussion of joins, we touched on the idea of using a “key” to determine what rows should be merged from each table. Let’s take a moment to examine this idea more closely.\nThe primary key is the column or set of columns in a table that determine the values of the remaining columns. It can be thought of as the unique identifier for each individual row in the table. For example, a table of Data 100 students might use each student’s Cal ID as the primary key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Cal ID\n      Name\n      Major\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      3034619471\n      Oski\n      Data Science\n    \n    \n      1\n      3035619472\n      Ollie\n      Computer Science\n    \n    \n      2\n      3025619473\n      Orrie\n      Data Science\n    \n    \n      3\n      3046789372\n      Ollie\n      Economics\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe foreign key is the column or set of columns in a table that reference primary keys in other tables. Knowing a dataset’s foreign keys can be useful when assigning the left_on and right_on parameters of .merge. In the table of office hour tickets below, \"Cal ID\" is a foreign key referencing the previous table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      OH Request\n      Cal ID\n      Question\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      3034619471\n      HW 2 Q1\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      3035619472\n      HW 2 Q3\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      3025619473\n      Lab 3 Q4\n    \n    \n      3\n      4\n      3035619472\n      HW 2 Q7"

    "text": "5.2 Granularity, Scope, and Temporality\nAfter understanding the structure of the dataset, the next task is to determine what exactly the data represents. We’ll do so by considering the data’s granularity, scope, and temporality.\nThe granularity of a dataset is the level of detail included in the data. To determine the data’s granularity, ask: what does each row in the dataset represent? Fine-grained data contains a high level of detail, with a single row representing a small individual unit. For example, each record may represent one person. Coarse-grained data is encoded such that a single row represents a large individual unit – for example, each record may represent a group of people.\nThe scope of a dataset is the subset of the population covered by the data. If we were investigating student performance in Data Science courses, a dataset with narrow scope might encompass all students enrolled in Data 100; a dataset with expansive scope might encompass all students in California.\nThe temporality of a dataset describes the time period over which the data was collected. To fully understand the temporality of the data, it may be necessary to standardize timezones or inspect recurring time-based trends in the data (Do patterns recur in 24-hour patterns? Over the course of a month? Seasonally?)."

    "text": "5.3 Faithfulness\nAt this stage in our data cleaning and EDA workflow, we’ve achieved quite a lot: we’ve identified how our data is structured, come to terms with what information it encodes, and gained insight as to how it was generated. Throughout this process, we should always recall the original intent of our work in Data Science – to use data to better understand and model the real world. To achieve this goal, we need to ensure that the data we use is faithful to reality; that is, that our data accurately captures the “real world.”\nData used in research or industry is often “messy” – there may be errors or inaccuracies that impact the faithfulness of the dataset. Signs that data may not be faithful include:\n\nUnrealistic or “incorrect” values, such as negative counts, locations that don’t exist, or dates set in the future\nViolations of obvious dependencies, like an age that does not match a birthday\nClear signs that data was entered by hand, which can lead to spelling errors or fields that are incorrectly shifted\nSigns of data falsification, such as fake email addresses or repeated use of the same names\nDuplicated records or fields containing the same information\n\nA common issue encountered with real-world datasets is that of missing data. One strategy to resolve this is to simply drop any records with missing values from the dataset. This does, however, introduce the risk of inducing biases – it is possible that the missing or corrupt records may be systemically related to some feature of interest in the data.\nAnother method to address missing data is to perform imputation: infer the missing values using other data available in the dataset. There is a wide variety of imputation techniques that can be implemented; some of the most common are listed below.\n\nAverage imputation: replace missing values with the average value for that field\nHot deck imputation: replace missing values with some random value\nRegression imputation: develop a model to predict missing values\nMultiple imputation: replace missing values with multiple random values\n\nRegardless of the strategy used to deal with missing data, we should think carefully about why particular records or fields may be missing – this can help inform whether or not the absence of these values is signficant in some meaningful way."

    "text": "6.1 CSVs and Field Names\nSuppose Table 1 was saved as a CSV file located in data/cdc_tuberculosis.csv.\nWe can then explore the CSV (which is a text file, and does not contain binary-encoded data) in many ways: 1. Using a text editor like emacs, vim, VSCode, etc. 2. Opening the CSV directly in DataHub (read-only), Excel, Google Sheets, etc. 3. The Python file object 4. pandas, using pd.read_csv()\n1, 2. Let’s start with the first two so we really solidify the idea of a CSV as rectangular data (i.e., tabular data) stored as comma-separated values.\n\nNext, let’s try using the Python file object. Let’s check out the first three lines:\n\n\n\nCode\nwith open(\"data/cdc_tuberculosis.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n    i = 0\n    for row in f:\n        print(row)\n        i += 1\n        if i > 3:\n            break\n\n\n,No. of TB cases,,,TB incidence,,\n\nU.S. jurisdiction,2019,2020,2021,2019,2020,2021\n\nTotal,\"8,900\",\"7,173\",\"7,860\",2.71,2.16,2.37\n\nAlabama,87,72,92,1.77,1.43,1.83\n\n\n\nWhoa, why are there blank lines interspaced between the lines of the CSV?\nYou may recall that all line breaks in text files are encoded as the special newline character \\n. Python’s print() prints each string (including the newline), and an additional newline on top of that.\nIf you’re curious, we can use the repr() function to return the raw string with all special characters:\n\n\nCode\nwith open(\"data/cdc_tuberculosis.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n    i = 0\n    for row in f:\n        print(repr(row)) # print raw strings\n        i += 1\n        if i > 3:\n

The pd.read_csv() function (documentation) has the convenient header parameter:\n\n\nCode\ntb_df = pd.read_csv(\"data/cdc_tuberculosis.csv\", header=1) # row index\ntb_df.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      U.S. jurisdiction\n      2019\n      2020\n      2021\n      2019.1\n      2020.1\n      2021.1\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Total\n      8,900\n      7,173\n      7,860\n      2.71\n      2.16\n      2.37\n    \n    \n      1\n      Alabama\n      87\n      72\n      92\n      1.77\n      1.43\n      1.83\n    \n    \n      2\n      Alaska\n      58\n      58\n      58\n      7.91\n      7.92\n      7.92\n    \n    \n      3\n      Arizona\n      183\n      136\n      129\n      2.51\n      1.89\n      1.77\n    \n    \n      4\n      Arkansas\n      64\n      59\n      69\n      2.12\n      1.96\n      2.28\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nWait…but now we can’t differentiate betwen the “Number of TB cases” and “TB incidence” year columns. pandas has tried to make our lives easier by automatically adding “.1” to the latter columns, but this doesn’t help us as humans understand the data.\nWe can do this manually with df.rename() (documentation):\n\n\nCode\nrename_dict = {'2019': 'TB cases 2019',\n               '2020': 'TB cases 2020',\n               '2021': 'TB cases 2021',\n               '2019.1': 'TB incidence 2019',\n               '2020.1': 'TB incidence 2020',\n               '2021.1': 'TB incidence 2021'}\ntb_df = tb_df.rename(columns=rename_dict)\ntb_df.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      U.S. jurisdiction\n      TB cases 2019\n      TB cases 2020\n      TB cases 2021\n      TB incidence 2019\n      TB incidence 2020\n      TB incidence 2021\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Total\n      8,900\n      7,173\n      7,860\n      2.71\n      2.16\n      2.37\n    \n    \n      1\n      Alabama\n      87\n      72\n      92\n      1.77\n      1.43\n      1.83\n    \n    \n      2\n      Alaska\n      58\n      58\n      58\n      7.91\n      7.92\n      7.92\n    \n    \n      3\n      Arizona\n      183\n      136\n      129\n      2.51\n      1.89\n      1.77\n    \n    \n      4\n      Arkansas\n      64\n      59\n      69\n      2.12\n      1.96\n      2.28"

    "text": "6.2 Record Granularity\nYou might already be wondering: What’s up with that first record?\nRow 0 is what we call a rollup record, or summary record. It’s often useful when displaying tables to humans. The granularity of record 0 (Totals) vs the rest of the records (States) is different.\nOkay, EDA step two. How was the rollup record aggregated?\nLet’s check if Total TB cases is the sum of all state TB cases. If we sum over all rows, we should get 2x the total cases in each of our TB cases by year (why?).\n\n\nCode\ntb_df.sum(axis=0)\n\n\nU.S. jurisdiction    TotalAlabamaAlaskaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaCol...\nTB cases 2019        8,9008758183642,111666718245583029973261085237...\nTB cases 2020        7,1737258136591,706525417194122219282169239376...\nTB cases 2021        7,8609258129691,750585443194992281064255127494...\nTB incidence 2019                                               109.94\nTB incidence 2020                                                93.09\nTB incidence 2021                                               102.94\ndtype: object\n\n\nWhoa, what’s going on?

This will make our cleaning slightly easier.\n\n\nCode\ntb_df = tb_df.set_index(\"U.S. jurisdiction\")\ntb_df.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      TB cases 2019\n      TB cases 2020\n      TB

that merge by default does an inner merge by default, meaning that it only preserves keys that are present in both DataFrames.\nThe rolled records in our census dataframes have different Geographic

The aggregate record we are looking for actually has the Geographic Area named “United States”.\nOne straightforward way to get the right merge is to rename the value itself. Because we now have the Geographic Area index, we’ll use df.rename() (documentation):\n\n\nCode\n# rename rolled record for 2010s\ncensus_2010s_df.rename(index={'United States':'Total'}, inplace=True)\ncensus_2010s_df.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      2010\n      2011\n      2012\n      2013\n      2014\n      2015\n      2016\n      2017\n      2018\n      2019\n    \n    \n      Geographic Area\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Total\n      309321666\n      311556874\n      313830990\n      315993715\n      318301008\n      320635163\n      322941311\n      324985539\n      326687501\n      328239523\n    \n    \n      Northeast\n      55380134\n      55604223\n      55775216\n      55901806\n      56006011\n      56034684\n      56042330\n      56059240\n      56046620\n      55982803\n    \n    \n      Midwest\n      66974416\n      67157800\n      67336743\n      67560379\n      67745167\n      67860583\n      67987540\n      68126781\n      68236628\n      68329004\n    \n    \n      South\n      114866680\n      116006522\n      117241208\n      118364400\n      119624037\n      120997341\n      122351760\n      123542189\n      124569433\n      125580448\n    \n    \n      West\n      72100436\n      72788329\n      73477823\n      74167130\n      74925793\n      75742555\n      76559681\n      77257329\n      77834820\n      78347268\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# same, but for 2020s rename rolled record\ncensus_2020s_df.rename(index={'United States':'Total'}, inplace=True)\ncensus_2020s_df.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      2020\n      2021\n      2022\n    \n    \n      Geographic Area\n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Total\n      331511512\n      332031554\n      333287557\n    \n    \n      Northeast\n      57448898\n      57259257\n      57040406\n    \n    \n      Midwest\n      68961043\n      68836505\n      68787595\n    \n    \n      South\n      126450613\n      127346029\n      128716192\n    \n    \n      West\n      78650958\n      78589763\n      78743364\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nNext let’s rerun our merge.

    "text": "6.2 Python String Methods\nFirst, we’ll introduce a few methods useful for string manipulation. The following table includes a number of string operations supported by Python and pandas.

While neither of these keys exist in our DataFrames, the County columns look similar enough. Can we convert these columns into one standard, canonical form to merge the two tables?\n\n6.2.1.1 Canonicalization with Python String Manipulation\nThe following function uses Python string manipulation to convert a single county name into canonical form. It does so by eliminating whitespace, punctuation, and unnecessary text.\n\ndef canonicalize_county(county_name):\n    return (\n        county_name\n            .lower()\n            .replace(' ', '')\n            .replace('&', 'and')\n            .replace('.', '')\n            .replace('county', '')\n            .replace('parish', '')\n    )\n\ncanonicalize_county(\"St. John the Baptist\")\n\n'stjohnthebaptist'\n\n\nWe will use the pandas map function to apply the canonicalize_county function to every row in both DataFrames. In doing so, we’ll create a new column in each called clean_county_python with the canonical form.\n\ncounty_and_pop['clean_county_python'] = county_and_pop['County'].map(canonicalize_county)\ncounty_and_state['clean_county_python'] = county_and_state['County'].map(canonicalize_county)\n\n\ndisplay(county_and_state), display(county_and_pop);\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      County\n      State\n      clean_county_python\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      De Witt County\n      IL\n      dewitt\n    \n    \n      1\n      Lac qui Parle County\n      MN\n      lacquiparle\n    \n    \n      2\n      Lewis and Clark County\n      MT\n      lewisandclark\n    \n    \n      3\n      St John the Baptist Parish\n      LS\n      stjohnthebaptist\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      County\n      Population\n      clean_county_python\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      DeWitt\n      16798\n      dewitt\n    \n    \n      1\n      Lac Qui Parle\n      8067\n      lacquiparle\n    \n    \n      2\n      Lewis & Clark\n      55716\n      lewisandclark\n    \n    \n      3\n      St. John the Baptist\n      43044\n      stjohnthebaptist\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.1.2 Canonicalization with Pandas Series Methods\nAlternatively, we can use pandas Series methods to create this standardized column. To do so, we must call the .str attribute of our Series object prior to calling any methods, like .lower and .replace. Notice how these method names match their equivalent built-in Python string functions.\nChaining multiple Series methods in this manner eliminates the need to use the map function (as this code is vectorized).\n\ndef canonicalize_county_series(county_series):\n    return (\n        county_series\n            .str.lower()\n            .str.replace(' ', '')\n            .str.replace('&', 'and')\n            .str.replace('.', '')\n            .str.replace('county', '')\n            .str.replace('parish', '')\n    )\n\ncounty_and_pop['clean_county_pandas'] = canonicalize_county_series(county_and_pop['County'])\ncounty_and_state['clean_county_pandas'] = canonicalize_county_series(county_and_state['County'])\n\n/var/folders/5n/kcn9fzv96pv305bh81xxb4l40000gn/T/ipykernel_93085/837021704.py:3: FutureWarning:\n\nThe default value of regex will change from True to False in a future version.

Unfortunately, these items are not in a fixed position from the beginning of the string, so slicing by some fixed offset won’t work.\nInstead, we can use some clever thinking. Notice how the relevant information is contained within a set of brackets, further seperated by / and :. We can hone in on this region of text, and split the data on these characters. Python’s built-in .split function makes this easy.\n\nfirst = log_lines[0] # Only considering the first row of data\n\npertinent = first.split(\"[\")[1].split(']')[0]\nday, month, rest = pertinent.split('/')\nyear, hour, minute, rest = rest.split(':')\nseconds, time_zone = rest.split(' ')\nday, month, year, hour, minute, seconds, time_zone\n\n('26', 'Jan', '2014', '10', '47', '58', '-0800')\n\n\nThere are two problems with this code:\n\nPython’s built-in functions limit us to extract data one record at a time\n\nThis can be resolved using a map function or Pandas Series methods.\n\nThe code is quite verbose\n\nThis is a larger issue that is trickier to solve\n\n\nIn the next section, we’ll introduce regular expressions - a tool that solves problem 2."

    "text": "6.3 Regex Basics\nA regular expression (“regex”) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. They are written to extract specific information from text. Regular expressions are essentially part of a smaller programming language embedded in Python, made available through the re module. As such, they have a stand-alone syntax and methods for various capabilities.\nRegular expressions are useful in many applications beyond data science. For example, Social Security Numbers (SSNs) are often validated with regular expresions.\n\nr\"[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}\" # Regular Expression Syntax\n\n# 3 of any digit, then a dash,\n# then 2 of any digit, then a dash,\n# then 4 of any digit\n\n'[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}'\n\n\n\n\nThere are a ton of resources to learn and experiment with regular expressions. A few are provided below:\n\nOfficial Regex Guide\nData 100 Reference Sheet\nRegex101.com\n\nBe sure to check Python under the category on the left.\n\n\n\n6.3.1 Basics Regex Syntax\nThere are four basic operations with regular expressions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperation\nOrder\nSyntax Example\nMatches\nDoesn’t Match\n\n\n\n\nOr: |\n4\nAA|BAAB\nAA BAAB\nevery other string\n\n\nConcatenation\n3\nAABAAB\nAABAAB\nevery other string\n\n\nClosure: *  (zero or more)\n2\nAB*A\nAA ABBBBBBA\nAB  ABABA\n\n\nGroup: ()  (parenthesis)\n1\nA(A|B)AAB    (AB)*A\nAAAAB ABAAB    A  ABABABABA\nevery other string    AA  ABBA\n\n\n\nNotice how these metacharacter operations are ordered. Rather than being literal characters, these metacharacters manipulate adjacent characters. () takes precedence, followed by *, and finally |. This allows us to differentiate between very different regex commands like AB* and (AB)*. The former reads “A then zero or more copies of B”, while the latter specifies “zero or more copies of AB”.\n\n6.3.1.1 Examples\nQuestion 1: Give a regular expression that matches moon, moooon, etc. Your expression should match any even number of os except zero (i.e. don’t match mn).\nAnswer 1: moo(oo)*n\n\nHardcoding oo before the capture group ensures that mn is not matched.\nA capture group of (oo)* ensures the number of o’s is even.\n\nQuestion 2: Using only basic operations, formulate a regex that matches muun, muuuun, moon, moooon, etc. Your expression should match any even number of us or os except zero (i.e. don’t match mn).\nAnswer 2: m(uu(uu)*|oo(oo)*)n\n\nThe leading m and trailing n ensures that only strings beginning with m and ending with n are matched.\nNotice how the outer capture group surrounds the |.\n\nConsider the regex m(uu(uu)*)|(oo(oo)*)n. This incorrectly matches muu and oooon.\n\nEach OR clause is everything to the left and right of |. The incorrect solution matches only half of the string, and ignores either the beginning m or trailing n.\nA set of paranthesis must surround |. That way, each OR clause is everything to the left and right of | within the group. This ensures both the beginning m and trailing n are matched."

    "text": "6.6 Regex in Python and Pandas (Regex Groups)\n\n6.6.1 Canonicalization\n\n6.6.1.1 Canonicalization with Regex\nEarlier in this note, we examined the process of canonicalization using Python string manipulation and pandas Series methods. However, we mentioned this approach had a major flaw: our code was unnecessarily verbose. Equipped with our knowledge of regular expressions, let’s fix this.\nTo do so, we need to understand a few functions in the re module. The first of these is the substitute function: re.sub(pattern, rep1, text). It behaves similarily to Python’s built-in .replace function, and returns text with all instances of pattern replaced by rep1.\nThe regular expression here removes text surrounded by <> (also known as HTML tags).\nIn order, the pattern matches … 1. a single < 2. any character that is not a > : div, td valign…, /td, /div 3. a single >\nAny substring in text that fulfills all three conditions will be replaced by ''.\n\nimport re\n\ntext = \"<div><td valign='top'>Moo</td></div>\"\npattern = r\"<[^>]+>\"\nre.sub(pattern, '', text) \n\n'Moo'\n\n\nNotice the r preceeding the regular expression pattern; this specifies the regular expression is a raw string. Raw strings do not recognize escape sequences (ie the Python newline metacharacter \\n). This makes them useful for regular expressions, which often contain literal \\ characters.\nIn other words, don’t forget to tag your regex with a r.\n\n\n6.6.1.2 Canonicalization with Pandas\nWe can also use regular expressions with Pandas Series methods. This gives us the benefit of operating on an entire column of data as opposed to a single value. The code is simple:  ser.str.replace(pattern, repl, regex=True).\nConsider the following DataFrame html_data with a single column.\n\n\nCode\ndata = {\"HTML\": [\"<div><td valign='top'>Moo</td></div>\", \\\n                 \"<a href='http://ds100.org'>Link</a>\", \\\n                 \"<b>Bold text</b>\"]}\nhtml_data = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n\n\nhtml_data\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      HTML\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      <div><td valign='top'>Moo</td></div>\n    \n    \n      1\n      <a href='http://ds100.org'>Link</a>\n    \n    \n      2\n      <b>Bold text</b>\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\npattern = r\"<[^>]+>\"\nhtml_data['HTML'].str.replace(pattern, '', regex=True)\n\n0          Moo\n1         Link\n2    Bold text\nName: HTML, dtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.2 Extraction\n\n6.6.2.1 Extraction with Regex\nJust like with canonicalization, the re module provides capability to extract relevant text from a string:  re.findall(pattern, text). This function returns a list of all matches to pattern.\nUsing the familiar regular expression for Social Security Numbers:\n\ntext = \"My social security number is 123-45-6789 bro, or maybe it’s 321-45-6789.\"\npattern = r\"[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}\"\nre.findall(pattern, text)  \n\n['123-45-6789', '321-45-6789']\n\n\n\n\n6.6.2.2 Extraction with Pandas\nPandas similarily provides extraction functionality on a Series of data: ser.str.findall(pattern)\nConsider the following DataFrame ssn_data.\n\n\nCode\ndata = {\"SSN\": [\"987-65-4321\", \"forty\", \\\n                \"123-45-6789 bro or 321-45-6789\",\n               \"999-99-9999\"]}\nssn_data = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n\n\nssn_data\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      SSN\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      987-65-4321\n    \n    \n      1\n      forty\n    \n    \n      2\n      123-45-6789 bro or 321-45-6789\n    \n    \n      3\n      999-99-9999\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nssn_data[\"SSN\"].str.findall(pattern)\n\n0                 [987-65-4321]\n1                            []\n2    [123-45-6789, 321-45-6789]\n3                 [999-99-9999]\nName: SSN, dtype: object\n\n\nThis function returns a list for every row containing the pattern matches in a given string.\n\n\n\n6.6.3 Regular Expression Capture Groups\nEarlier we used parentheses ( ) to specify the highest order of operation in regular expressions. However, they have another meaning; paranthesis are often used to represent capture groups. Capture groups are essentially, a set of smaller regular expressions that match multiple substrings in text data.\nLet’s take a look at an example.\n\n6.6.3.1 Example 1\n\ntext = \"Observations: 03:04:53 - Horse awakens. \\\n        03:05:14 - Horse goes back to sleep.\"\n\nSay we want to capture all occurences of time data (hour, minute, and second) as seperate entities.\n\npattern_1 = r\"(\\d\\d):(\\d\\d):(\\d\\d)\"\nre.findall(pattern_1, text)\n\n[('03', '04', '53'), ('03', '05', '14')]\n\n\nNotice how the given pattern has 3 capture groups, each specified by the regular expression (\\d\\d). We then use re.findall to return these capture groups, each as tuples containing 3 matches.\nThese regular expression capture groups can be different. We can use the (\\d{2}) shorthand to extract the same data.\n\npattern_2 = r\"(\\d\\d):(\\d\\d):(\\d{2})\"\nre.findall(pattern_2, text)\n\n[('03', '04', '53'), ('03', '05', '14')]\n\n\n\n\n6.6.3.2 Example 2\nWith the notion of capture groups, convince yourself how the following regular expression works.\n\nfirst = log_lines[0]\nfirst\n\n'169.237.46.168 - - [26/Jan/2014:10:47:58 -0800] \"GET /stat141/Winter04/ HTTP/1.1\" 200 2585 \"http://anson.ucdavis.edu/courses/\"\\n'\n\n\n\npattern = r'\\[(\\d+)\\/(\\w+)\\/(\\d+):(\\d+):(\\d+):(\\d+) (.+)\\]'\nday, month, year, hour, minute, second, time_zone = re.findall(pattern, first)[0]\nprint(day, month, year, hour, minute, second, time_zone)\n\n26 Jan 2014 10 47 58 -0800"

Instead, future examples will focus on other libaries built specifically for visualizing data. The most well-known library here is matplotlib.\n\n\n7.4.2 Plotting in Matplotlib\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nms = births['Maternal Smoker'].value_counts()\nplt.bar(ms.index.astype('string'), ms)\nplt.xlabel('Maternal Smoker')\nplt.ylabel('Count');\n\n\n\n\nWhile more code is required to achieve the same result, matplotlib is often used over pandas for its ability to plot more complex visualizations, some of which are discussed shortly.\nHowever, notice how we need to explicitly specify the type of the value for the x-axis to string. In absence of conversion, the x-axis will be a range of integers rather than the two categories, True and False. This is because matplotlib coerces True to a value of 1 and False to 0. Also, note how we needed to label the axes with plt.xlabel and plt.ylabel - matplotlib does not support automatic axis labeling. To get around these inconveniences, we can use a more effecient plotting library, seaborn.\n\n\n7.4.3 Plotting in Seaborn\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.countplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Smoker');\n\n\n\n\nseaborn.countplot both counts and visualizes the number of unique values in a given column. This column is specified by the x argument to sns.countplot, while the DataFrame is specified by the data argument.\nFor the vast majority of visualizations, seaborn is far more concise and aesthetically pleasing than matplotlib. However, the color scheme of this particular bar plot is abritrary - it encodes no additional information about the categories themselves. This is not always true; color may signify meaningful detail in other visualizations. We’ll explore this more in-depth during the next lecture.\n\n\n7.4.4 Plotting in Plotly\n\nplotly is one of the most versatile plottling libraries and widely used in industry. However, plotly has various dependencies that make it difficult to support in Data 100. Therfore, we have intentionally excluded the code to generate the plot above.\nBy now, you’ll have noticed that each of these plotting libraries have a very different syntax. As with pandas, we’ll teach you the important methods in matplotlib and seaborn, but you’ll learn more through documentation.\n\nMatplotlib Documentation\nSeaborn Documentation\n\nExample Questions:\n\nWhat colors should we use?\nHow wide should the bars be?\nShould the legend exist?\nShould the bars and axes have dark borders?\n\nTo accomplish goal 2, here are some ways we can improve plot:\n\nIntroducing different colors for each bar\nIncluding a legend\nIncluding a title\nLabeling the y-axis\nUsing color-blind friendly palettes\nRe-orienting the labels\nIncrease the font size"

In the previous example, these were the unique values of the Maternal Smoker column: True and False. If we use similar logic here, our categories are the different numerical weights contained in the Maternal Pregnancy Weight column.\nUnder this assumption, let’s plot this distribution using the seaborn.countplot function.\n\nsns.countplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Pregnancy Weight');\n\n\n\n\nThis histogram clearly suffers from overplotting. This is somewhat expected for Maternal Pregnancy Weight - it is a quantitative variable that takes on a wide range of values.\nTo combat this problem, statisticians use bins to categorize numerical data. Luckily, seaborn provides a helpful plotting function that automatically bins our data.\n\nsns.histplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Pregnancy Weight');\n\n\n\n\nThis diagram is known as a histogram. While it looks more reasonable, notice how we lose fine-grain information on the distribution of data contained within each bin. We can introduce rug plots to minimize this information loss. An overlaid “rug plot” displays the within-bin distribution of our data, as denoted by the thickness of the colored line on the x-axis.\n\nsns.histplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Pregnancy Weight');\nsns.rugplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Pregnancy Weight', color = 'red');\n\n\n\n\nYou may have seen histograms drawn differently - perhaps with an overlaid density curve and normalized y-axis. We can display both with a few tweaks to our code.\nTo visualize a density curve, we can set the the kde = True argument of the sns.histplot. Setting the argument stat = 'density' normalizes our histogram and displays densities, instead of counts, on the y-axis. You’ll notice that the area under the density curve is 1.\n\nsns.histplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Pregnancy Weight', kde = True, \n             stat = 'density')\nsns.rugplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Pregnancy Weight', color = 'red');"

In a right-skewed distribution, the few large outliers “pull” the mean to the right of the median.\nIf a distribution has a long left tail, it is skewed left. In a left-skewed distribution, the few small outliers “pull” the mean to the left of the median.\nIn the case where a distribution has equal-sized right and left tails, it is symmetric. The mean is approximately equal to the median. Think of mean as the balancing point of the distribution\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nsns.histplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Pregnancy Weight');\ndf_mean = np.mean(births['Maternal Pregnancy Weight'])\ndf_median = np.median(births['Maternal Pregnancy Weight'])\nprint(\"The mean is: {} and the median is {}\".format(df_mean,df_median))\n\nThe mean is: 128.4787052810903 and the median is 125.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.6.2 Outliers\nLoosely speaking, an outlier is defined as a data point that lies an abnormally large distance away from other values. We’ll define the statistical measure for this shortly.\nOutliers disproportionately influce the mean because their magnitude is directly involved in computing the average. However, the median is largely unaffected - the magnitude of an outlier is irrelevant; we only care that it is some non-zero distance away from the midpoint of the data.\n\nsns.histplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Pregnancy Weight');\n## Where do we draw the line of outlier? \nplt.axvline(df_mean*1.75, color = 'red');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.6.3 Modes\nA mode of a distribution is a local or global maximum. A distribution with a single clear maximum is unimodal, distributions with two modes are bimodal, and those with 3 or more are multimodal. You need to distinguish between modes and random noise.\nFor example, the distribution of birth weights for maternal smokers is (weakly) multimodal.\n\nbirths_maternal_smoker = births[births['Maternal Smoker'] == True]\nsns.histplot(data = births_maternal_smoker, x = 'Maternal Pregnancy Weight')\\\n            .set(title = 'Maternal Smoker histogram');\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the distribution of birth weights for maternal non-smokers is weakly bi-modal.\n\nbirths_maternal_non_smoker = births[births['Maternal Smoker'] == False]\nsns.histplot(data = births_maternal_non_smoker, x = 'Maternal Pregnancy Weight')\\\n            .set(title = 'Maternal Non-Smoker histogram');\n\n\n\n\nHowever, changing the bins reveals that the data is not bi-modal.\n\nsns.histplot(data = births_maternal_non_smoker, x = 'Maternal Pregnancy Weight',\\\n             bins = 20);"

The numerical values on the Y-axis for a sample of 100 units would be the same for when we observe a sample of 10000 units instead. We can still calculate the absolute number of observed units using density.\nExample: There are 1174 observations total. - Total area of this bin should be: 120/1174 = ~10% - Density of this bin is therefore: 10% / (115 - 110) = 0.02"

In this section, we’ll learn how to construct density curves using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).\n\n8.1.1.1 Smoothing\nKernel Density Estimation involves a technique called smoothing - a process applied to a distribution of values that allows us to analyze the more general structure of the dataset.\nMany of the visualizations we learned during the last lecture are examples of smoothing. Histograms are smoothed versions of one-dimensional rug plots, and hex plots are smoother alternatives to two-dimensional scatter plots. They remove the detail from individual observations so we can visualize the larger properties of our distribution.\n\n\nCode\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ntitanic = sns.load_dataset('titanic')\nsns.rugplot(titanic['age'],height = 0.5);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsns.histplot(titanic['age']);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.1.2 Kernel Density Estimation\nKernel Density Estimation is a smoothing technique that allows us to estimate a density curve (also known as a probability density function) from a set of observations. There are a few steps in this process:\n\nPlace a kernel at each data point\nNormalize kernels to have total area of 1 (across all kernels)\nSum kernels together\n\nSuppose we have 5 data points: \\([2.2, 2.8, 3.7, 5.3, 5.7]\\). We wish to recreate the following Kernel Density Estimate:\n\n\nCode\ndata = [2.2, 2.8, 3.7, 5.3, 5.7]\nsns.kdeplot(data);\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s walk through each step to construct this density curve.\n\n8.1.1.2.1 Step 1 - Place a Kernel at Each Data Point\nTo begin generating a density curve, we need to choose a kernel and bandwidth value (\\(\\alpha\\)). What are these exactly? A kernel is a density curve itself, and the bandwidth (\\(\\alpha\\)) is a measure of the kernel’s width. Recall that a valid density has an area of 1.\nAt each of our 5 points (depicted in the rug plot on the left), we’ve placed a Gaussian kernel with a bandwidth parameter of alpha = 1. We’ll explore what these are in the next section.\n\n\nRugplot of Data\n\n\n\n\nKernelized Data\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.1.2.2 Step 2 - Normalize Kernels to Have Total Area of 1\nNotice how these 5 kernels are density curves - meaning they each have an area of 1. In Step 3, we will be summing each these kernels, and we want the result to be a valid density that has an area of 1. Therefore, it makes sense to normalize our current set of kernels by multiplying each by \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\n\nKernelized Data\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Kernels\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.1.2.3 Step 3 - Sum Kernels Together\nOur kernel density estimate (KDE) is the sum of the normalized kernels along the x-axis. It is depicted below on the right.\n\n\nNormalized Kernels\n\n\n\n\nKernel Density Estimate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Kernel Functions and Bandwidth\n\n8.1.2.1 Kernels\nA kernel (for our purposes) is a valid density function. This means it:\n\nMust be non-negative for all inputs.\nMust integrate to 1.\n\n\nA general “KDE formula” function is given above.\n\n\\(K_{\\alpha}(x, xi)\\) is the kernel centered on the observation i.\n\nEach kernel individually has area 1.\nx represents any number on the number line. It is the input to our function.\n\n\\(n\\) is the number of observed data points that we have.\n\nWe multiply by \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) so that the total area of the KDE is still 1.\n\nEach \\(x_i \\in \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\}\\) represents an observed data point.\n\nThese are what we use to create our KDE by summing multiple shifted kernels centered at these points.\n\n\n*\\(\\alpha\\) (alpha) is the bandwidth or smoothing parameter.\n\n8.1.2.1.1 Gaussian Kernel\nThe most common kernel is the Gaussian kernel. The Gaussian kernel is equivalent to the Gaussian probability density function (the Normal distribution), centered at the observed value \\(x_i\\) with a standard deviation of \\(\\alpha\\) (this is known as the bandwidth parameter).\n\\(K_a(x, x_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\alpha^{2}}}e^{-\\frac{(x-x_i)^{2}}{2\\alpha^{2}}}\\)\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n\ndef gaussian_kernel(alpha, x, z):\n    return 1.0/np.sqrt(2. * np.pi * alpha**2) * np.exp(-(x - z) ** 2 / (2.0 * alpha**2))\n\nxs = np.linspace(-5, 5, 200)\nalpha = 1\nkde_curve = [gaussian_kernel(alpha, x, 0) for x in xs]\nplt.plot(xs, kde_curve);\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gaussian kernel centered at 0 with bandwidth \\(\\alpha\\) = 1.\n\n\n\n\nIf you’ve taken a probability class, you’ll recognize that the mean of this Gaussian kernel is \\(x_i\\) and the standard deviation is \\(\\alpha\\). Increasing \\(\\alpha\\) - equivalently, the bandwidth - smoothens the density curve. Larger values of \\(\\alpha\\) are typically easier to understand; however, we begin to lose important distributional information.\nHere is how adjusting \\(\\alpha\\) affects a distribution in some variable from an arbitrary dataset.\n\n\nGaussian Kernel, \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.1\n\n\n\n\nGaussian Kernel, \\(\\alpha\\) = 1\n\n\n\n\n\nGaussian Kernel, \\(\\alpha\\) = 2\n\n\n\n\nGaussian Kernel, \\(\\alpha\\) = 10\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2.1.2 Boxcar Kernel\nAnother example of a kernel is the Boxcar kernel. The boxcar kernel assigns a uniform density to points within a “window” of the observation, and a density of 0 elsewhere. The equation below is a Boxcar kernel with the center at \\(x_i\\) and the bandwidth of \\(\\alpha\\).\n\\(K_a(x, x_i) = \\begin{cases}  \\frac{1}{\\alpha}, & |x - x_i| \\le \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\\\  0, & \\text{else }  \\end{cases}\\)\n\n\nCode\ndef boxcar_kernel(alpha, x, z):\n    return (((x-z)>=-alpha/2)&((x-z)<=alpha/2))/alpha\n\nxs = np.linspace(-5, 5, 200)\nalpha=1\nkde_curve = [boxcar_kernel(alpha, x, 0) for x in xs]\nplt.plot(xs, kde_curve);\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Boxcar kernel centered at 0 with bandwidth \\(\\alpha\\) = 1.\n\n\n\n\nThe diagram on the right is how the density curve for our 5 point dataset would have looked had we used the Boxcar kernel with bandwidth \\(\\alpha\\) = 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Relationships Between Quantitative Variables\nUp until now, we’ve discussed how to visualize single-variable distributions. Going beyond this, we want to understand the relationship between pairs of numerical variables.\n\n8.1.3.1 Scatter Plots\nScatter plots are one of the most useful tools in representing the relationship between two quantitative variables. They are particularly important in gauging the strength, or correlation between variables. Knowledge of these relationships can then motivate decisions in our modeling process.\nFor example, let’s plot a scatter plot comparing the Maternal Height and Birth Weight colums, using both matplotlib and seaborn.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nbirths = pd.read_csv(\"data/baby.csv\")\nbirths.head(5)\n\n# Matplotlib Example\nplt.scatter(births['Maternal Height'], births['Birth Weight'])\nplt.xlabel('Maternal Height')\nplt.ylabel('Birth Weight');\n\n\n\n\n\n# Seaborn Example\nsns.scatterplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Height', y = 'Birth Weight',\n                hue = 'Maternal Smoker')\n\n<AxesSubplot:xlabel='Maternal Height', ylabel='Birth Weight'>\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example where color is used to add a third dimension to our plot. This is possible with the hue paramater in seaborn, which adds a categorical column encoding to an existing visualization. This way, we can look for relationships in Maternal Height and Birth Weight in both maternal smokers and non-smokers. If we wish to see the relationship’s strength more clearly, we can use sns.lmplot.\n\nsns.lmplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Height', y = 'Birth Weight', \n           hue = 'Maternal Smoker', ci = False);\n\n\n\n\nWe can make out a weak, positive relationship in the mother’s height and birth weight for both maternal smokers and non-smokers (the baseline is slightly lower in maternal smokers).\n\n\n\n8.1.4 Overplotting\nAs you may have noticed, the scatterplots of Maternal Height vs. Birth Weight have many densely plotted areas. Many of the points are on top of one other! This makes it difficult to tell exactly how many babies are plotted in each the more densely populated regions of the graph. This can arise when the tools used for measuring data have low granularity, many different values are rounded to the same value, or if the ranges of the two variables differ greatly in scale.\nWe can overcome this by introducing a small amount of uniform random noise to our data. This is called jittering. Let’s see what happens when we introduce noise to the Maternal Height.\n\nbirths[\"Maternal Height (jittered)\"] = births[\"Maternal Height\"] + np.random.uniform(-0.2, 0.2, len(births))\nsns.lmplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Height (jittered)', y = 'Birth Weight', \n           hue = 'Maternal Smoker', ci = False);\n\n\n\n\nThis plot more clearly shows that most of the data is clustered tightly around the point (62.5,120) and gradually becomes more loose further away from the center. It is much easier for us and others to see how the data is distributed. In conclusion, jittering helps us better understand our own data (Goal 1) and communicate results to others (Goal 2).\n\n8.1.4.1 Hex Plots and Contour Plots\nUnfortunately, our scatter plots above suffered from overplotting, which made them hard to interpret. And with a large number of points, jittering is unlikely to resolve the issue. Instead, we can look to hex plots and contour plots.\nHex Plots can be thought of as a two dimensional histogram that shows the joint distribution between two variables. This is particularly useful working with very dense data.\n\nsns.jointplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Pregnancy Weight', \n              y = 'Birth Weight', kind = 'hex')\n\n<seaborn.axisgrid.JointGrid at 0x156b22370>\n\n\n\n\n\nThe axes are evidently binned into hexagons, which makes the linear relationship easier to decipher. Darker regions generally indicate a higher density of points.\nOn the other hand, contour plots are two dimensional versions of density curves with marginal distributions of each variable on the axes. We’ve used very similar code here to generate our contour plots, with the addition of the kind = 'kde' and fill = True arguments.\n\nsns.jointplot(data = births, x = 'Maternal Height', y = 'Birth Weight',\\\n              kind = 'kde', fill = True)\n\n<seaborn.axisgrid.JointGrid at 0x156c86640>"

    "text": "8.2 Transformations\nThese last two lectures have covered visualizations in great depth. We looked at various forms of visualizations, plotting libraries, and high-level theory.\nMuch of this was done to uncover insights in data, which will prove necessary for the modeling process. A strong graphical correlation between two variables hinted an underlying relationship that has reason for further study. However, relying on visual relationships alone is limiting - not all plots show association. The presence of outliers and other statistical anomalies make it hard to interpret data.\nTransformations are the process of manipulating data to find significant relationships between variables. These are often found by applying mathematical functions to variables that “transform” their range of possible values and highlight some previously hidden associations between data.\n\n8.2.0.1 Transforming a Distribution\nWhen a distribution has a large dynamic range, it can be useful to take the logarithm of the data. For example, computing the logarithm of the ticket prices on the Titanic reduces skeweness and yields a distribution that is more “spread” across the x-axis. While it makes individual observations harder to interpret, the distribution is more favorable for subsequent analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.0.2 Linearizing a Relationship\nTransformations are perhaps most useful to linearize a relationship between variables. If we find a transformation to make a scatter plot of two variables linear, we can “backtrack” to find the exact relationship between the variables. Linear relationships are particularly simple to interpret, and we’ll be doing a lot of linear modeling in Data 100 - starting next week!\nSay we want to understand the relationship between healthcare and life expectancy. Intuitively there should be a positive correlation, but upon plotting values from a dataset, we find a non-linear relationship that is somewhat hard to understand. However, applying a logarithmic transformation to both variables - healthcare and life expectancy - results in a scatter plot with a linear trend that we can interpret.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can we find the relationship between the original variables? We know that taking a log of both axes gave us a linear relationship, so we can say (roughly) that\n\\[\\log y= a\\times\\log x + b\\]\nSolving for \\(y\\) implies a power relationship in the original plot.\n\\[y= e^{a\\times\\log x + b}\\] \\[y= Ce^{a\\times\\log x}\\] \\[y= Cx^{a}\\]\nHow did we know that taking the logarithm of both sides would result in a linear relationship? The Tukey-Mosteller Bulge Diagram is helpful here. We can use the direction of the buldge in our original data to find the appropriate transformations that will linearize the relationship. These transformations are found on axes that are nearest to the buldge. The buldge in our earlier example lay in Quadrant 2, so the transformations \\(\\log x\\), \\(\\sqrt x\\), \\(y^{2}\\), or \\(y^{3}\\) are possible contenders. It’s important to note that this diagram is not perfect, and some transformations will work better than others. In our case, \\(\\log x\\) and \\(\\log y\\) (found in Quadrant 3) were the best.\n\n\n\n8.2.0.3 Additional Remarks\nVisualization requires a lot of thought! - There are many tools for visualizing distributions. - Distribution of a single variable: 1. rug plot 2. histogram 3. density plot 4. box plot 5. violin plot - Joint distribution of two quantitative variables: 1. scatter plot 2. hex plot 3. contour plot.\nThis class primarily uses seaborn and matplotlib, but Pandas also has basic built-in plotting methods. Many other visualization libraries exist, and plotly is one of them. - plotly creates very easily creates interactive plots. - plotly will occasionally appear in lecture code, labs, and assignments!\nNext, we’ll go deeper into the theory behind visualization."

    "section": "8.3 Visualization Theory",
    "text": "8.3 Visualization Theory\nThis section marks a pivot to the second major topic of this lecture - visualization theory. We’ll discuss the abstract nature of visualizations and analyze how they convey information.\nRemember, we had two goals for visualizing data. This section is particularly important in:\n\nHelping us understand the data and results\nCommunicating our results and conclusions with others\n\n\n8.3.1 Information Channels\nVisualizations are able to convey information through various encodings. In the remainder of this lecture, we’ll look at the use of color, scale, and depth, to name a few.\n\n8.3.1.1 Encodings in Rugplots\nOne detail that we may have overlooked in our earlier discussion of rugplots is the importance of encodings. Rugplots are effective visuals because they utilize line thickness to encode frequency. Consider the following diagram:\n\n\n\n8.3.1.2 Multi-Dimensional Encodings\nEncodings are also useful for representing multi-dimensional data. Notice how the following visual highlights four distinct “dimensions” of data:\n\nX-axis\nY-axis\nArea\nColor\n\n\nThe human visual perception sytem is only capable of visualizing data in a three-dimensional plane, but as you’ve seen, we can encode many more channels of information.\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Harnessing the Axes\n\n8.3.2.1 Consider Scale of the Data\nHowever, we should be careful to not misrepresent relationships in our data by manipulating the scale or axes. The visualization below improperly portrays two seemingly independent relationships on the same plot. The authors have clearly changed the scale of the y-axis to mislead their audience.\n\nNotice how the downwards-facing line segment contains values in the millions, while the upwards-trending segment only contains values near three hundred thousand. These lines should not be intersecting.\nWhen there is a large difference in the magnitude of the data, it’s advised to analyze percentages instead of counts. The following diagrams correctly display the trends in cancer screening and abortion rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2.2 Reveal the Data\nGreat visualizations not only consider the scale of the data, but also utilize the axes in a way that best conveys information. For example, data scientists commonly set certain axes limits to highlight parts of the visualization they are most interested in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visualization on the right captures the trend in coronavirus cases during the month March in 2020. From only looking at the visualization on the left, a viewer may incorrectly believe that coronavirus began to skyrocket on March 4th, 2020. However, the second illustration tells a different story - cases rose closer to March 21th, 2020.\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Harnessing Color\nColor is another important feature in visualizations that does more than what meets the eye.\nLast lecture, we used color to encode a categorical variable in our scatter plot. In this section, we will discuss uses of color in novel visualizations like colormaps and heatmaps.\n5-8% of the world is red-green color blind, so we have to be very particular about our color scheme. We want to make these as accessible as possible. Choosing a set of colors which work together is evidently a challenging task!\n\n8.3.3.1 Colormaps\nColormaps are mappings from pixel data to color values, and they’re often used to highlight distinct parts of an image. Let’s investigate a few properties of colormaps.\n\n\nJet Colormap \n\n\n\nViridis Colormap \n\n\nThe jet colormap is infamous for being misleading. While it seems more vibrant than viridis, the aggressive colors poorly encode numerical data. To understand why, let’s analyze the following images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe diagram on the left compares how a variety of colormaps represent pixel data that transitions from a high to low intensity. These include the jet colormap (row a) and grayscale (row b). Notice how the grayscale images do the best job in smoothly transitioning between pixel data. The jet colormap is the worst at this - the four images in row (a) look like a conglomeration of individual colors.\nThe difference is also evident in the images labeled (a) and (b) on the left side. The grayscale image is better at preserving finer detail in the vertical line strokes. Additionally, grayscale is preferred in x-ray scans for being more neutral. The intensity of dark red color in the jet colormap is frightening and indicates something is wrong.\nWhy is the jet colormap so much worse? The answer lies in how its color composition is percieved to the human eye.\n\n\nJet Colormap Perception \n\n\n\nViridis Colormap Perception \n\n\nThe jet colormap is largely misleading because it is not perceptually uniform. Perceptually uniform colormaps have the property that if the pixel data goes from 0.1 to 0.2, the perceptual change is the same as when the data goes from 0.8 to 0.9.\nNotice how the said uniformity is present within the linear trend displayed in the viridis colormap. On the other hand, the jet colormap is largely non-linear - this is precisely why it’s considered a worse colormap.\n\n\n\n8.3.4 Harnessing Markings\nIn our earlier discussion of multi-dimensional encodings, we analyzed a scatter plot with four pseudo-dimensions: the two axes, area, and color. Were these appropriate to use? The following diagram analyzes how well the human eye can distinguish between these “markings”.\n\nThere are a few key takeaways from this diagram\n\nLengths are easy to discern. Don’t use plots with jiggled baselines - keep everything axis-aligned.\nAvoid pie charts! Angle judgements are inaccurate.\nAreas and volumes are hard to distinguish (area charts, word clouds, etc)\n\n\n\n8.3.5 Harnessing Conditioning\nConditioning is the process of comparing data that belong to seperate groups. We’ve seen this before in overlayed distributions, side-by-side box-plots, and scatter plots with categorical encodings. Here, we’ll introduce terminology that formalizes these examples.\nConsider an example where we want to analyze income earnings for male and females with varying levels of education. There are multiple ways to compare this data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe barplot is an example of juxtaposition: placing multiple plots side by side, with the same scale. The scatter plot is an example of superposition: placing multiple density curves, scatter plots on top of each other.\nWhich is better depends on the problem at hand. Here, superposition makes the precise wage difference very clear from a quick glance. But many sophisticated plots convey information that favors the use of juxtaposition. Below is one example.\n\n\n\n8.3.6 Harnessing Context\nThe last component to a great visualization is perhaps the most critical - the use of context. Adding informative titles, axis labels, and descriptive captions are all best practices that we’ve heard repeatedly in Data 8.\nA publication-ready plot (and every Data 100 plot) needs:\n\nInformative title (takeaway, not description)\nAxis labels\nReference lines, markers, etc\nLegends, if appropriate\nCaptions that describe data\n\nCaptions should be:\n\nComprehensive and self-contained\nDescribe what has been graphed\nDraw attention to important features\nDescribe conclusions drawn from graphs"

    "section": "9.1 Censuses and Surveys",
    "text": "9.1 Censuses and Surveys\nIn general: a census is “an official count or survey of a population, typically recording various details of individuals.”\n\nExample: The U.S. Decennial Census was held in April 2020, and it counts every person living in all 50 states, DC, and US territories. (Not just citizens.) Participation is required by law (it is mandated by the U.S. Constitution). Important uses include the allocation of Federal funds, congressional representation, and drawing congressional and state legislative districts. The census is composed of a survey mailed to different housing addresses in the United States.\nIndividuals in a population are not always people. Other populations include: bacteria in your gut (sampled using DNA sequencing); trees of a certain species; small businesses receiving a microloan; or published results in an academic journal / field.\n\nA survey is a set of questions. An example is workers sampling individuals and households. What is asked, and how it is asked, can affect how the respondent answers, or even whether the respondent answers in the first place.\nWhile censuses are great, it is often difficult and expensive to survey everyone in a population. Thus, we usually survey a subset of the population instead.\nA sample is often used to make inferences about the population. That being said, how the sample is drawn will affect the reliability of such inferences. Two common source of error in sampling are chance error, where random samples can vary from what is expected, in any direction; and bias, which is a a systematic error in one direction.\nBecause of how surveys and samples are drawn, it turns out that samples are usually—but not always—a subset of the population: * Population: The group that you want to learn something about. * Sampling Frame: The list from which the sample is drawn. For example, if sampling people, then the sampling frame is the set of all people that could possibly end up in your sample. * Sample: Who you actually end up sampling. The sample is therefore a subset of your sampling frame.\nWhile ideally these three sets would be exactly the same, in practice they usually aren’t. For example, there may be individuals in your sampling frame (and hence, your sample) that are not in your population. And generally, sample sizes are much smaller than population sizes.\n\n\n\nSampling_Frames"

    "section": "9.2 Bias: A Case Study",
    "text": "9.2 Bias: A Case Study\nThe following case study is adapted from Statistics by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves, W.W. Norton NY, 1978.\nIn 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt (D) went up for re-election against Alf Landon (R) . As is usual, polls were conducted in the months leading up to the election to try and predict the outcome. The Literary Digest was a magazine that had successfully predicted the outcome of 5 general elections coming into 1936. In their polling for the 1936 election, they sent out their survey to 10 million individuals, who they found from phone books, lists of magazine subscribers, and lists of country club members. Of the roughly 2.4 million people who filled out the survey, only 43% reported they would vote for Roosevelt; thus the Digest predicted that Landon would win.\nOn election day, Roosevelt won in a landslide, winning 61% of the popular vote of about 45 million voters. How could the Digest have been so wrong with their polling?\nIt turns out that the Literary Digest sample was not representative of the population. Their sampling frame inherently skewed towards more affluent voters, who tended to vote Republican, and they completely overlooked the lion’s share of voters who were still suffering through the Great Depression. Furthermore, they had a dismal response rate (about 24%); who knows how the other non-respondents would have polled? The Digest folded just 18 months after this disaster.\nAt the same time, George Gallup, a rising statistician, also made predictions about the 1936 elections. His estimate (56% Roosevelt) was much closer despite having a smaller sample size of “only” 50,000 (still more than necessary; more when we cover the Central Limit Theorem). Gallup also predicted the Digest’s prediction within 1%, with a sample size of only 3000 people. He did so by anticipating the Digest’s affluent sampling frame and subsampled those individuals. The Gallup Poll today is one of the leading polls for election results.\nSo what’s the moral of the story? Samples, while convenient, are subject to chance error and bias. Election polling, in particular, can involve many sources of bias. To name a few: * Selection bias systematically excludes (or favors) particular groups. * Response bias occurs because people don’t always respond truthfully. Survey designers pay special detail to the nature and wording of questions to avoid this type of bias. * Non-response bias occurs because people don’t always respond to survey requests, which can skew responses. For example, the Gallup poll is conducted through landline phone calls, but many different populations in the U.S. do not pay for a landline, and still more do not always answer the phone. Surveyers address this bias by staying persistent and keeping surveys short."

    "text": "9.3 Probability Samples\nWhen sampling, it is essential to focus on the quality of the sample rather than the quantity of the sample. A huge sample size does not fix a bad sampling method. Our main goal is to gather a sample that is representative of the population it came from. The most common way to accomplish this is by randomly sampling from the population.\n\nA convenience sample is whatever you can get ahold of. Note that haphazard sampling is not necessarily random sampling; there are many potential sources of bias.\nIn a probability sample, we know the chance any given set of individuals will be in the sample.\n\nProbability samples allow us to estimate the bias and chance error, which helps us quantify uncertainty (more in a future lecture).\nNote that this does not imply that all individuals in the population need have the same chance of being selected (see: stratified random samples).\nFurther note that the real world is usually more complicated. For example, we do not generally know the probability that a given bacterium is in a microbiome sample, or whether people will answer when Gallup calls landlines. That being said, we try to model probability sampling where possible if the sampling or measurement process is not fully under our control.\n\n\nA few common random sampling schemes: * A random sample with replacement is a sample drawn uniformly at random with replacement. * Random doesn’t always mean “uniformly at random,” but in this specific context, it does. * Some individuals in the population might get picked more than once\n\nA simple random sample (SRS) is a sample drawn uniformly at random without replacement.\n\nEvery individual (and subset of individuals) has the same chance of being selected.\nEvery pair has the same chance as every other pair.\nEvery triple has the same chance as every other triple.\nAnd so on.\n\nA stratified random sample, where random sampling is performed on strata (specific groups), and the groups together compose a sample.\n\n\n9.3.1 Example: Stratified random sample\nSuppose that we are trying to run a poll to predict the mayoral election in Bearkeley City (an imaginary city that neighbors Berkeley). Suppose we try a stratified random sample to select 100 voters as follows: 1. First, we take a simple random sample and obtain 50 voters that are above the median city income (“above-median-income”), i.e., in the upper 50-th percentile of income in the city. 2. We then take a simple random sample of the other 50 from voters that are below the median city income.\nThis is a probability sample: For any group of 100 people, if there are not exactly 50 “above-median-income” voters, then that group has zero probability of being chosen. For any other group (which has exactly 50 “above-median-income” voters), then the chance of it being chosen is 1/ # of such groups.\nNote that even if we replace the group counts with 80/20 (80 “above-median-income” voters, 20 others), then it is still a probability sample, because we can compute the precise probability of each group being chosen. However, the sampling scheme (and thus the modeling of voter preferences) becomes biased towards voters with income above the median."

    "text": "9.4 Approximating Simple Random Sampling\nThe following is a very common situation in data science: - We have an enormous population. - We can only afford to sample a relatively small number of individuals. If the population is huge compared to the sample, then random sampling with and without replacement are pretty much the same.\nExample : Suppose there are 10,000 people in a population. Exactly 7,500 of them like Snack 1; the other 2,500 like Snack 2. What is the probability that in a random sample of 20, all people like Snack 1?\n\nMethod 1: SRS (Random Sample Without Replacement): \\(\\prod\\limits_{k=0}^{19} \\dfrac{7500 - k}{10000 - k} \\approx 0.003151\\)\nMethod 2: Random Sample with Replacement: \\((0.75)^{20} \\approx 0.003171\\)\n\nAs seen here, when the population size is large, probabilities of sampling with replacement are much easier to compute and lead to a reasonable approximation.\n\n9.4.1 Multinomial Probabilities\nThe approximation discussed above suggests the convenience of multinomial probabilities, which arise from sampling a categorical distribution at random **with replacement*.\nSuppose that we have a bag of marbles with the following distribution: 60% are blue, 30% are green, and 10% are red. If we then proceed to draw 100 marbles from this bag, at random with replacement, then the resulting 100-size sample is modeled as a multinomial distribution using np.random.multinomial:\n\nimport numpy as np\nnp.random.multinomial(100, [0.60, 0.30, 0.10])\n\narray([54, 39,  7])\n\n\nThis method allows us to generate, say, 10 samples of size 100 using the size parameter:\n\nnp.random.multinomial(100, [0.60, 0.30, 0.10], size=10)\n\narray([[60, 26, 14],\n       [47, 41, 12],\n       [59, 31, 10],\n       [62, 31,  7],\n       [56, 33, 11],\n       [59, 31, 10],\n       [57, 30, 13],\n       [62, 27, 11],\n       [56, 34, 10],\n       [52, 33, 15]])"

    "text": "9.5 Comparing Convenience Sample and SRS\nSuppose that we are trying to run a poll to predict the mayoral election in Bearkeley City (an imaginary city that neighbors Berkeley). Suppose we took a sample to predict the election outcome by polling all retirees. Even if they answer truthfully, we have a convenience sample. How biased would this sample be in predicting the results? While we will not numerically quantify the bias, in this demo we’ll visually show that because of the voter population distribution, any error in our prediction from a retiree sample cannot be simply due to chance:\nFirst, let’s grab a data set that has every single voter in the Bearkeley (again, this is a fake dataset) and how they actually voted in the election. For the purposes of this example, assume: * “high income” indicates a voter is above the median household income, which is $97,834 (actual Berkeley number). * There are only two mayoral candidates: one Democrat and one Republican. * Every registered voter votes in the election for the candidate under their registered party (Dem or Rep).\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nbearkeley = pd.read_csv(\"data/bearkeley.csv\")\n\n# create a 1/0 int that indicates democratic vote\nbearkeley['vote.dem'] = (bearkeley['vote'] == 'Dem').astype(int)\nbearkeley.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      age\n      high_income\n      vote\n      vote.dem\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      35\n      False\n      Dem\n      1\n    \n    \n      1\n      42\n      True\n      Rep\n      0\n    \n    \n      2\n      55\n      False\n      Dem\n      1\n    \n    \n      3\n      77\n      True\n      Rep\n      0\n    \n    \n      4\n      31\n      False\n      Dem\n      1\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nbearkeley.shape\n\n(1300000, 4)\n\n\n\nactual_vote = np.mean(bearkeley[\"vote.dem\"])\nactual_vote\n\n0.5302792307692308\n\n\nThis is the actual outcome of the election. Based on this result, the Democratic candidate would win. However, if we were to only consider retiree voters (a retired person is anyone age 65 and up):\n\nconvenience_sample = bearkeley[bearkeley['age'] >= 65]\nnp.mean(convenience_sample[\"vote.dem\"])\n\n0.3744755089093924\n\n\nBased on this result, we would have predicted that the Republican candidate would win! This error is not due to the sample being too small to yield accurate predictions, because there are 359,396 retirees (about 27% of the 1.3 million Bearkeley voters). Instead, there seems to be something larger happening. Let’s visualize the voter preferences of the entire population to see how retirees trend:\nLet us aggregate all voters by age and visualize the fraction of Democratic voters, split by income.\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.ticker as ticker\n\nsns.set_theme(style='darkgrid', font_scale = 1.5,\n              rc={'figure.figsize':(7,5)})\n\n# aggregate all voters by age\nvotes_by_demo = bearkeley.groupby([\"age\",\"high_income\"]).agg(\"mean\").reset_index()\n\nfig = plt.figure();\nred_blue = [\"#bf1518\", \"#397eb7\"]\nwith sns.color_palette(sns.color_palette(red_blue)):\n    ax = sns.pointplot(data=votes_by_demo, x = \"age\", y = \"vote.dem\", hue = \"high_income\")\n\nax.set_title(\"Voting preferences by demographics\")\nfig.canvas.draw()\nnew_ticks = [i.get_text() for i in ax.get_xticklabels()];\nplt.xticks(range(0, len(new_ticks), 10), new_ticks[::10]);\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot above, we see that retirees in the imaginary city of Bearkeley tend to vote less Democrat, which skewed our predictions from our sample. We also note that high-income voters tend to vote less Democrat (and more Republican).\nLet’s compare our biased convenience sample to a simple random sample. Supposing we took an SRS the same size as our retiree sample, we see that we get a result very close to the actual vote:\n\n## By default, replace = False\nn = len(convenience_sample)\nrandom_sample = bearkeley.sample(n, replace = False)\n\nnp.mean(random_sample[\"vote.dem\"])\n\n0.529788867989627\n\n\nThis is very close to the actual vote!\nWe could even get pretty close with a much smaller sample size, say 800:\nIt turns out that we are pretty close, much smaller sample size, say, 800 (we’ll learn how to choose this number when we introduce the Central Limit Theorem):\n\nn = 800\nrandom_sample = bearkeley.sample(n, replace = False)\nnp.mean(random_sample[\"vote.dem\"])\n\n0.4975\n\n\nTo visualize the chance error in an SRS, let’s simulate 1000 samples of the 800-size Simple Random Sample:\n\npoll_result = []\nnrep = 1000   # number of simulations\nn = 800       # size of our sample\nfor i in range(0,nrep):\n    random_sample = bearkeley.sample(n, replace = False)\n    poll_result.append(np.mean(random_sample[\"vote.dem\"]))\nsns.histplot(poll_result, stat='density', kde=True)\n\n# What fraction of these simulated samples would have predicted Democrat?\npoll_result = pd.Series(poll_result)\nnp.sum(poll_result >= 0.5)/1000\n\n0.957\n\n\n\n\n\nA few observations: First, the KDE looks roughly Gaussian. Second, supposing that we predicted a Democratic winner if 50% of our sample voted Democrat, then just about 4% of our simulated samples would have predicted the election result incorrectly. This visualization further justifies why our convenience sample had error that was not entirely just due to chance. We’ll revisit this notion later in the course."

    "text": "10.1 What is a Model?\nA model is an idealized representation of a system. A system is a set of principles or procedures according to which something functions. We live in a world full of systems: the procedure of turning on a light happens according to a specific set of rules dictating the flow of electricity. The truth behind how any event occurs are usually complex, and many times the specifics are unknown. The workings of the world can be viewed is its own giant procedure. Models seek to simplify the world and distill them it into workable pieces.\nExample: We model the fall of an object on Earth as subject to a constant acceleration of \\(9.81 \\frac{m}{s^2}\\) due to gravity.\n\nWhile this describes the behavior of our system, it is merely an approximation.\nIt doesn’t account for the effects of air resistance, local variations in gravity, etc.\nIn practice, it’s accurate enough to be useful!\n\n\n10.1.1 Reasons for building models\nOften times, (1) we care about creating models that are simple and interpretable, allowing us to understand what the relationships between our variables are. Other times, (2) we care more about making extremely accurate predictions, at the cost of having an uninterpretable model. These are sometimes called black-box models, and are common in fields like deep learning.\n\nTo understand complex phenomena occurring in the world we live in.\n\nWhat factors play a role in the growth of COVID-19?\nHow do an object’s velocity and acceleration impact how far it travels? (Physics: \\(d = d_0 + vt + \\frac{1}{2}at^2\\))\n\nTo make accurate predictions about unseen data.\n\nCan we predict if an email is spam or not?\nCan we generate a one-sentence summary of this 10-page long article?\n\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Common Types of Models\nIn general, models can be split into two categories:\nNote: These specific models are not in the scope of Data 100 and exist to serve as motivation.\n\nDeterministic physical (mechanistic) models: Laws that govern how the world works.\n\nKepler’s Third Law of Planetary Motion (1619): The ratio of the square of an object’s orbital period with the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit is the same for all objects orbiting the same primary.\n\n\\(T^2 \\propto R^3\\)\n\nNewton’s Laws: motion and gravitation (1687): Newton’s second law of motion models the relationship between the mass of an object and the force required to accelerate it.\n\n\\(F = ma\\)\n\\(F_g = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\\)\n\n\nProbabilistic models: models that attempt to understand how random processes evolve. These are more general and can be used describe many phenomena in the real world. These models commonly make simplifying assumption about the nature of the world.\n\nPoisson Process models: Used to model random events that can happen with some probability at any point in time and are strictly increasing in count, such as the arrival of customers at a store."

In Data 100, we’ll treat a model as some mathematical rule we use to describe the relationship between variables.\nWhat variables are we modeling? Typically, we use a subset of the variables in our sample of collected data to model another variable in this data. To put this more formally, say we have the following dataset \\(\\mathbb{D}\\):\n\\[\\mathbb{D} = \\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)\\}\\]\nEach pair of values \\((x_i, y_i)\\) represents a datapoint. In a modeling setting, we call these observations. \\(y_i\\) is the dependent variable we are trying to model, also called an output or response. \\(x_i\\) is the independent variable inputted into the model to make predictions, also known as a feature.\nOur goal in modeling is to use the observed data \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) to predict the output variable \\(y_i\\). We denote each prediction as \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) (read: “y hat sub i”).\nHow do we generate these predictions? Some examples of models we’ll encounter in the next few lectures are given below:\n\\[\\hat{y}_i = \\theta\\] \\[\\hat{y}_i = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_i\\]\nThe examples above are known as parametric models.

While the features, \\(x_i\\), are taken from our observed data, we need to decide what values to give \\(\\theta\\), \\(\\theta_0\\), and \\(\\theta_1\\) ourselves.

    "text": "10.5 Choosing a Loss Function\nWe’ve talked about the idea of creating the “best” possible predictions. This begs the question: how do we decide how “good” or “bad” our model’s predictions are?\nA loss function characterizes the cost, error, or fit resulting from a particular choice of model or model parameters. This function, \\(L(y, \\hat{y})\\), quantifies how “far off” a single prediction by our model is from a true, observed value in our collected data.\nThe choice of loss function for a particular model depends on the modeling task at hand. Regardless of the specific function used, a loss function should follow two basic principles:\n\nIf the prediction \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is close to the actual value \\(y_i\\), loss should be low\nIf the prediction \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is far from the actual value \\(y_i\\), loss should be high\n\nTwo common choices of loss function are squared loss and absolute loss.\nSquared loss, also known as L2 loss, computes loss as the square of the difference between the observed \\(y_i\\) and predicted \\(\\hat{y}_i\\): \\[L(y_i, \\hat{y}_i) = (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\\]\nAbsolute loss, also known as L1 loss, computes loss as the absolute difference between the observed \\(y_i\\) and predicted \\(\\hat{y}_i\\): \\[L(y_i, \\hat{y}_i) = |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|\\]\nL1 and L2 loss give us a tool for quantifying our model’s performance on a single datapoint. This is a good start, but ideally we want to understand how our model performs across our entire dataset. A natural way to do this is to compute the average loss across all datapoints in the dataset. This is known as the cost function, \\(\\hat{R}(\\theta)\\): \\[\\hat{R}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum^n_{i=1} L(y_i, \\hat{y}_i)\\]\nThe cost function has many names in statistics literature.

    "section": "10.6 Fitting the Model",
    "text": "10.6 Fitting the Model\nNow that we’ve established the concept of a loss function, we can return to our original goal of choosing model parameters. Specifically, we want to choose the best set of model parameters that will minimize the model’s cost on our dataset. This process is called fitting the model.\nWe know from calculus that a function is minimized when (1) its first derivative is equal to zero and (2) its second derivative is positive. We often call the function being minimized the objective function (our objective is to find its minimum).\nTo find the optimal model parameter, we:\n\nTake the derivative of the cost function with respect to that parameter\nSet the derivative equal to 0\nSolve for the parameter\n\nWe repeat this process for each parameter present in the model. For now, we’ll disregard the second derivative condition.\nTo help us make sense of this process, let’s put it into action by deriving the optimal model parameters for simple linear regression using the mean squared error as our cost function. Remember: although the notation may look tricky, all we are doing is following the three steps above!\nStep 1: take the derivative of the cost function with respect to each model parameter. We substitute the SLR model, \\(\\hat{y}_i = \\theta_0+\\theta_1 x_i\\), into the definition of MSE above and differentiate with respect to \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\). \\[\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\theta_0 - \\theta_1 x_i)^2\\]\n\\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_0} \\text{MSE} = \\frac{-2}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - \\theta_0 - \\theta_1 x_i\\]\n\\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_1} \\text{MSE} = \\frac{-2}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\theta_0 - \\theta_1 x_i)x_i\\]\nStep 2: set the derivatives equal to 0. After simplifying terms, this produces two estimating equations. The best set of model parameters \\((\\theta_0, \\theta_1)\\) must satisfy these two optimality conditions. \\[0 = \\frac{-2}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - \\theta_0 - \\theta_1 x_i \\Longleftrightarrow \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - \\hat{y}_i = 0\\] \\[0 = \\frac{-2}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\theta_0 - \\theta_1 x_i)x_i \\Longleftrightarrow \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)x_i = 0\\]\nStep 3: solve the estimating equations to compute estimates for \\(\\hat{\\theta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\theta}_1\\).\nTaking the first equation gives the estimate of \\(\\hat{\\theta}_0\\): \\[\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \\hat{\\theta}_0 - \\hat{\\theta}_1 x_i = 0 \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\right) - \\hat{\\theta}_0 - \\hat{\\theta}_1\\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\right) = 0 \\\\\n\\hat{\\theta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\theta}_1 \\bar{x}\n\\]\nWith a bit more maneuvering, the second equation gives the estimate of \\(\\hat{\\theta}_1\\). Start by multiplying the first estimating equation by \\(\\bar{x}\\), then subtracting the result from the second estimating equation. \\[\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)x_i - \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)\\bar{x} = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)(x_i - \\bar{x}) = 0\n\\]\nNext, plug in \\(\\hat{y}_i = \\hat{\\theta}_0 + \\hat{\\theta}_1 x_i = \\bar{y} + \\hat{\\theta}_1(x_i - \\bar{x})\\): \\[\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\theta}_1(x - \\bar{x}))(x_i - \\bar{x}) = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y})(x_i - \\bar{x}) = \\hat{\\theta}_1 \\times \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2\n\\]\nBy using the definition of correlation \\(\\left(r = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\frac{x_i-\\bar{x}}{\\sigma_x})(\\frac{y_i-\\bar{y}}{\\sigma_y}) \\right)\\) and standard deviation \\(\\left(\\sigma_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\right)\\), we can conclude: \\[r \\sigma_x \\sigma_y = \\hat{\\theta}_1 \\times \\sigma_x^2\\] \\[\\hat{\\theta}_1 = r \\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sigma_x}\\]\nJust as was given in Data 8!\nRemember, this derivation found the optimal model parameters for SLR when using the MSE cost function. If we had used a different model or different loss function, we likely would have found different values for the best model parameters. However, regardless of the model and loss used, we can always follow these three steps to fit the model."

We call this constant \\(\\theta\\).\n\\[\\hat{y}_i = \\theta\\]\n\\(\\theta\\) is the parameter of the constant model, just as \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\) were the parameters in SLR. Our task now is to determine what value of \\(\\theta\\) represents the optimal model – in other words, what number should we guess each time to have the lowest possible average loss on our data?\nConsider the case where L2 (squared) loss is used as the loss function and mean squared error is used as the cost function. At this stage, we’re well into the modeling process:\n\nChoose a model: constant model\nChoose a loss function: L2 loss\nFit the model\nEvaluate model performance\n\nIn Homework 5, you will fit the constant model under MSE cost to find that the best choice of \\(\\theta\\) is the mean of the observed \\(y\\) values.

This optimal model parameter, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), is the value of \\(\\theta\\) that minimizes the cost \\(R\\).\nFor modeling purposes, we care less about the minimum value of cost, \\(R(\\hat{\\theta})\\), and more about the value of \\(\\theta\\) that results in this lowest average loss.

When \\(\\theta\\) is less than \\(y_i\\), the term \\(y_i - \\theta\\) will be positive and the absolute value has no impact. When \\(\\theta\\) is greater than \\(y_i\\), the term \\(y_i - \\theta\\) will be negative. Applying the absolute value will convert this to a positive value, which we can express by saying \\(-(y_i - \\theta) = \\theta - y_i\\).\n\\[|y_i - \\theta| = \\begin{cases} y_i - \\theta \\quad \\text{ if: } \\theta < y_i \\\\ \\theta - y_i \\quad \\text{if: }\\theta > y_i \\end{cases}\\]\nTaking derivatives:\n\\[\\frac{d}{d\\theta} |y_i - \\theta| = \\begin{cases} \\frac{d}{d\\theta} (y_i - \\theta) = -1 \\quad \\text{if: }\\theta < y_i \\\\ \\frac{d}{d\\theta} (\\theta - y_i) = 1 \\quad \\text{if: }\\theta > y_i \\end{cases}\\]\nThis means that we obtain a different value for the derivative for datapoints where \\(\\theta < y_i\\) and where \\(\\theta > y_i\\). We can summarize this by saying:\n\\[\\frac{d}{d\\theta} R(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum^{n}_{i=1} \\frac{d}{d\\theta} |y_i - \\theta| \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{n} \\left[\\sum_{\\theta < y_i} (-1) + \\sum_{\\theta > y_i} (+1) \\right]\n\\]\nTo finish finding the best value of \\(\\theta\\), set this derivative equal to zero and solve for \\(\\theta\\). You’ll do this in Homework 5 to show that \\(\\hat{\\theta} = \\text{median}(y)\\)."

    "text": "11.3 Comparing Loss Functions\nNow, we’ve tried our hand at fitting a model under both MSE and MAE cost functions. How do the two results compare?\nLet’s consider a dataset where each entry represents the number of drinks sold at a bubble tea store each day. We’ll fit a constant model to predict the number of drinks that will be sold tomorrow.\n\nimport numpy as np\ndrinks = np.array([20, 21, 22, 29, 33])\ndrinks\n\narray([20, 21, 22, 29, 33])\n\n\nFrom our derivations above, we know that the optimal model parameter under MSE cost is the mean of the dataset. Under MAE cost, the optimal parameter is the median of the dataset.\n\nnp.mean(drinks), np.median(drinks)\n\n(25.0, 22.0)\n\n\nIf we plot each empirical risk function across several possible values of \\(\\theta\\), we find that each \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) does indeed correspond to the lowest value of error:\n\nNotice that the MSE above is a smooth function – it is differentiable at all points, making it easy to minimize using numerical methods. The MAE, in contrast, is not differentiable at each of its “kinks.” We’ll explore how the smoothness of the cost function can impact our ability to apply numerical optimization in a few weeks.\nHow do outliers affect each cost function? Imagine we replace the largest value in the dataset with 1000. The mean of the data increases substantially, while the median is nearly unaffected.\n\ndrinks_with_outlier = np.append(drinks, 1000)\ndisplay(drinks_with_outlier)\nnp.mean(drinks_with_outlier), np.median(drinks_with_outlier)\n\narray([  20,   21,   22,   29,   33, 1000])\n\n\n(187.5, 25.5)\n\n\nThis means that under the MSE, the optimal model parameter \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is strongly affected by the presence of outliers. Under the MAE, the optimal parameter is not as influenced by outlying data. We can generalize this by saying that the MSE is sensitive to outliers, while the MAE is robust to outliers.\nLet’s try another experiment. This time, we’ll add an additional, non-outlying datapoint to the data.\n\ndrinks_with_additional_observation = np.append(drinks, 35)\ndrinks_with_additional_observation\n\narray([20, 21, 22, 29, 33, 35])\n\n\nWhen we again visualize the cost functions, we find that the MAE now plots a horizontal line between 22 and 29. This means that there are infinitely many optimal values for the model parameter: any value \\(\\hat{\\theta} \\in [22, 29]\\) will minimize the MAE. In contrast, the MSE still has a single best value for \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). In other words, the MSE has a unique solution for \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\); the MAE is not guaranteed to have a single unique solution."

    "text": "11.4 Evaluating Models\nThis leaves us with one final question – how “good” are the predictions made by this “best” fitted model?\nOne way we might want to evaluate our model’s performance is by computing summary statistics. If the mean and standard deviation of our predictions are close to those of the original observed \\(y_i\\)s, we might be inclined to say that our model has done well. A large magnitude for the correlation coefficient between the feature and response variables might also support this conclusion. However, we should be cautious with this approach. To see why, we’ll consider a classic dataset called Anscombe’s quartet.\n\nIt turns out that the four sets of points shown here all have identical means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients. However, it only makes sense to model the first of these four sets of data using SLR! It is important to visualize your data before starting to model to confirm that your choice of model makes sense for the data.\nAnother way of evaluating model performance is by using performance metrics. A common choice of metric is the Root Mean Squared Error, or RMSE. The RMSE is simply the square root of MSE. Taking the square root converts the value back into the original, non-squared units of \\(y_i\\), which is useful for understanding the model’s performance. A low RMSE indicates more “accurate” predictions – that there is lower average loss across the dataset. \\[\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}\\]\nWe may also wish to visualize the model’s residuals, defined as the difference between the observed and predicted \\(y_i\\) value (\\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\)). This gives a high-level view of how “off” each prediction is from the true observed value. Recall that you explored this concept in Data 8: a good regression fit should display no clear pattern in its plot of residuals. The residual plots for Anscombe’s quartet are displayed below. Note how only the first plot shows no clear pattern to the magnitude of residuals. This is an indication that SLR is not the best choice of model for the remaining three sets of points."

    "text": "11.5 Linear Transformations\nAt this point, we have an effective method of fitting models to predict linear relationships. Given a feature variable and target, we can apply our four-step process to find the optimal model parameters.\nA key word above is linear. When we computed parameter estimates earlier, we assumed that \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) shared roughly a linear relationship.\nData in the real world isn’t always so straightforward. Consider the dataset below, which contains information about the ages and lengths of dugongs.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndugong = pd.read_csv(\"data/dugongs.txt\", delimiter=\"\\t\").sort_values(\"Length\")\nx, y = dugong[\"Length\"], dugong[\"Age\"]\n\n# `corrcoef` computes the correlation coefficient between two variables\n# `std` finds the standard deviation\nr = np.corrcoef(x, y)[0, 1]\ntheta_1 = r*np.std(y)/np.std(x)\ntheta_0 = np.mean(y) - theta_1*np.mean(x)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, dpi=200, figsize=(8, 3))\nax[0].scatter(x, y)\nax[0].set_xlabel(\"Length\")\nax[0].set_ylabel(\"Age\")\n\nax[1].scatter(x, y)\nax[1].plot(x, theta_0 + theta_1*x, \"tab:red\")\nax[1].set_xlabel(\"Length\")\nax[1].set_ylabel(\"Age\");\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the plot on the left, we see that there is a slight curvature to the data points. Plotting the SLR curve on the right results in a poor fit.\nFor SLR to perform well, we’d like there to be a rough linear trend relating \"Age\" and \"Length\". What is making the raw data deviate from a linear relationship? Notice that the data points with \"Length\" greater than 2.6 have disproportionately high values of \"Age\" relative to the rest of the data. If we could manipulate these data points to have lower \"Age\" values, we’d “shift” these points downwards and reduce the curvature in the data. Applying a logarithmic transformation to \\(y_i\\) (that is, taking \\(\\log(\\) \"Age\" \\()\\) ) would achieve just that.\nAn important word on \\(\\log\\): in Data 100 (and most upper-division STEM courses), \\(\\log\\) denotes the natural logarithm with base \\(e\\). The base-10 logarithm, where relevant, is indicated by \\(\\log_{10}\\).\n\n\nCode\nz = np.log(y)\n\nr = np.corrcoef(x, z)[0, 1]\ntheta_1 = r*np.std(z)/np.std(x)\ntheta_0 = np.mean(z) - theta_1*np.mean(x)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, dpi=200, figsize=(8, 3))\nax[0].scatter(x, z)\nax[0].set_xlabel(\"Length\")\nax[0].set_ylabel(r\"$\\log{(Age)}$\")\n\nax[1].scatter(x, z)\nax[1].plot(x, theta_0 + theta_1*x, \"tab:red\")\nax[1].set_xlabel(\"Length\")\nax[1].set_ylabel(r\"$\\log{(Age)}$\")\n\nplt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0.3);\n\n\n\n\n\nOur SLR fit looks a lot better! We now have a new target variable: the SLR model is now trying to predict the log of \"Age\", rather than the untransformed \"Age\". In other words, we are applying the transformation \\(z_i = \\log{(y_i)}\\). The SLR model becomes:\n\\[\\log{\\hat{(y_i)}} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_i\\] \\[\\hat{z}_i = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_i\\]\nIt turns out that this linearized relationship can help us understand the underlying relationship between \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\). If we rearrange the relationship above, we find: \\[\n\\log{(y_i)} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_i \\\\\ny_i = e^{\\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_i} \\\\\ny_i = (e^{\\theta_0})e^{\\theta_1 x_i} \\\\\ny_i = C e^{k x_i}\n\\]\nFor some constants \\(C\\) and \\(k\\).\n\\(y_i\\) is an exponential function of \\(x_i\\). Applying an exponential fit to the untransformed variables corroborates this finding.\n\n\nCode\nplt.figure(dpi=120, figsize=(4, 3))\n\nplt.scatter(x, y)\nplt.plot(x, np.exp(theta_0)*np.exp(theta_1*x), \"tab:red\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Length\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Age\");\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may wonder: why did we choose to apply a log transformation specifically? Why not some other function to linearize the data?\nPractically, many other mathematical operations that modify the relative scales of \"Age\" and \"Length\" could have worked here. The Tukey-Mosteller Bulge Diagram is a useful tool for summarizing what transformations can linearize the relationship between two variables. To determine what transformations might be appropriate, trace the shape of the “bulge” made by your data. Find the quadrant of the diagram that matches this bulge. The transformations shown on the vertical and horizontal axes of this quadrant can help improve the fit between the variables."

Say we collect information on several variables when making an observation. For example, we may record the age, height, and weekly hours of sleep for a student in Data 100. This single observation now contains data for multiple features. To accommodate for the fact that we now consider several feature variables, we’ll adjust our notation slightly. Each observation can now be thought of as a row vector with an entry for each of \\(p\\) features.\n\nThe multiple Linear regression model takes the form:\n\\[\\hat{y}_i = \\theta_0\\:+\\:\\theta_1x_{i1}\\:+\\:\\theta_2 x_{i2}\\:+\\:...\\:+\\:\\theta_p x_{ip}\\]\nOur \\(i\\)th prediction, \\(\\hat{y}_i\\), is a linear combination of the parameters, \\(\\theta_i\\).

    "text": "12.3 Linear Algebra Approach\nWe now know how to generate a single prediction from multiple observed features. Data scientists usually work at scale – that is, they want to build models that can produce many predictions, all at once. The vector notation we introduced above gives us a hint on how we can expedite multiple Linear regression. We want to use the tools of linear algebra.\nLet’s think carefully about what we did to generate the single prediction above. To make a prediction from the first observation in the data, we took the scalar product of the parameter vector and first observation vector. To make a prediction from the second observation, we would repeat this process to find the scalar product of the parameter vector and the second observation vector. If we wanted to find the model predictions for each observation in the dataset, we’d repeat this process for all \\(n\\) observations in the data.\n\\[\\hat{y}_1 = [1,\\:x_{11},\\:x_{12},\\:x_{13},\\:...,\\:x_{1p}] \\theta\\] \\[\\hat{y}_2 = [1,\\:x_{21},\\:x_{22},\\:x_{23},\\:...,\\:x_{2p}] \\theta\\] \\[\\vdots\\] \\[\\hat{y}_n = [1,\\:x_{n1},\\:x_{n2},\\:x_{n3},\\:...,\\:x_{np}] \\theta\\]\nOur observed data is represented by \\(n\\) row vectors, each with dimension \\((p+1)\\). We can collect them all into a single matrix, which we call \\(\\mathbb{X}\\).\n\nThe matrix \\(\\mathbb{X}\\) is known as the design matrix. It contains all observed data for each of our \\(p\\) features. It often (but not always) contains an additional column of all ones to represent the intercept or bias column.\nTo review what is happening in the design matrix: each row represents a single observation. For example, a student in Data 100. Each column represents a feature. For example, the ages of students in Data 100. This convention allows us to easily transfer our previous work in DataFrames over to this new linear algebra perspective.\n\nThe multiple Linear regression model can then be restated in terms of matrices: \\[\\mathbb{\\hat{Y}} = \\mathbb{X} \\theta\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathbb{\\hat{Y}}\\) is the prediction vector with dimensions \\((n \\times 1)\\). It contains the prediction made by the model for each of \\(n\\) input observations.\nWe now have a new approach to understanding models in terms of vectors and matrices. To accompany this new convention, we should update our understanding of cost functions and model fitting.\nRecall our definition of MSE: \\[R(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\\]\nAt its heart, the MSE is a measure of distance – it gives an indication of how “far away” the predictions are from the true values, on average.\nWhen working with vectors, this idea of “distance” is represented by the norm. More precisely, the distance between two vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) can be expressed as: \\[||\\vec{a} - \\vec{b}||_2 = \\sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2 + \\ldots + (a_n - b_n)^2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i - b_i)^2}\\]\nThe double bars are mathematical notation for the norm. The subscript 2 indicates that we are computing the L2, or squared norm.\nLooks pretty familiar! We can rewrite the MSE to express it as a squared L2 norm in terms of the prediction vector, \\(\\hat{\\mathbb{Y}}\\), and true target vector, \\(\\mathbb{Y}\\):\n\\[R(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\frac{1}{n} ||\\mathbb{Y} - \\hat{\\mathbb{Y}}||_2^2\\]\nHere, the superscript 2 outside of the norm double bars means that we are squaring the norm. If we plug in our linear model \\(\\hat{\\mathbb{Y}} = \\mathbb{X} \\theta\\), we find the MSE cost function in vector notation:\n\\[R(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{n} ||\\mathbb{Y} - \\mathbb{X} \\theta||_2^2\\]\nUnder the linear algebra perspective, our new task is to fit the optimal parameter vector \\(\\theta\\) such that the cost function is minimized. Equivalently, we wish to minimize the norm \\[||\\mathbb{Y} - \\mathbb{X} \\theta||_2 = ||\\mathbb{Y} - \\hat{\\mathbb{Y}}||_2\\].\nWe can restate this goal in two ways:\n\nMinimize the distance between the vector of true values, \\(\\mathbb{Y}\\), and the vector of predicted values, \\(\\mathbb{\\hat{Y}}\\)\nMinimize the length of the residual vector, defined as: \\[e = \\mathbb{Y} - \\mathbb{\\hat{Y}} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n         y_1 - \\hat{y}_1 \\\\\n         y_2 - \\hat{y}_2 \\\\\n         \\vdots \\\\\n         y_n - \\hat{y}_n\n       \\end{bmatrix}\\]"

We can also think of \\(\\hat{\\mathbb{Y}}\\) as a linear combination of feature vectors, scaled by the parameters. We use the notation \\(\\mathbb{X}_{:, i}\\) to denote the \\(i\\)th column of the design matrix.

In other words, the span represents every point in space that could possibly be reached by adding and scaling some combination of the matrix columns.\nBecause the prediction vector, \\(\\hat{\\mathbb{Y}} = \\mathbb{X} \\theta\\), is a linear combination of the columns of \\(\\mathbb{X}\\), we know that the predictions are contained in the span of \\(\\mathbb{X}\\). That is, we know that \\(\\mathbb{\\hat{Y}} \\in \\text{Span}(\\mathbb{X})\\).\nThe diagram below is a simplified view of \\(\\text{Span}(\\mathbb{X})\\), assuminh that each column of \\(\\mathbb{X}\\) has length \\(n\\). Notice that the columns of \\(\\mathbb{X}\\) define a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), where each point in the subspace can be reached by a linear combination of \\(\\mathbb{X}\\)’s columns. The prediction vector \\(\\mathbb{\\hat{Y}}\\) lies somewhere in this subspace.\n\nExamining this diagram, we find a problem. The vector of true values, \\(\\mathbb{Y}\\), could theoretically lie anywhere in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) space – its exact location depends on the data we collect out in the real world. However, our multiple Linear regression model can only make predictions in the subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) spanned by \\(\\mathbb{X}\\). Remember the model fitting goal we established in the previous section: we want to generate predictions such that the distance between the vector of true values, \\(\\mathbb{Y}\\), and the vector of predicted values, \\(\\mathbb{\\hat{Y}}\\), is minimized. This means that we want \\(\\mathbb{\\hat{Y}}\\) to be the vector in \\(\\text{Span}(\\mathbb{X})\\) that is closest to \\(\\mathbb{Y}\\).\nAnother way of rephrasing this goal is to say that we wish to minimize the length of the residual vector \\(e\\), as measured by its \\(L_2\\) norm.\n\nThe vector in \\(\\text{Span}(\\mathbb{X})\\) that is closest to \\(\\mathbb{Y}\\) is always the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbb{Y}\\) onto \\(\\text{Span}(\\mathbb{X})\\). Thus, we should choose the parameter vector \\(\\theta\\) that makes the residual vector orthogonal to any vector in \\(\\text{Span}(\\mathbb{X})\\). You can visualize this as the vector created by dropping a perpendicular line from \\(\\mathbb{Y}\\) onto the span of \\(\\mathbb{X}\\).\nHow does this help us identify the optimal parameter vector, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\)? Recall that two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero. A vector \\(\\vec{v}\\) is orthogonal to the span of a matrix \\(M\\) if \\(\\vec{v}\\) is orthogonal to each column in \\(M\\). Put together, a vector \\(\\vec{v}\\) is orthogonal to \\(\\text{Span}(M)\\) if:\n\\[M^T \\vec{v} = \\vec{0}\\]\nBecause our goal is to find \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) such that the residual vector \\(e = \\mathbb{Y} - \\mathbb{X} \\theta\\) is orthogonal to \\(\\text{Span}(\\mathbb{X})\\), we can write:\n\\[\\mathbb{X}^T e = \\vec{0}\\] \\[\\mathbb{X}^T (\\mathbb{Y} - \\mathbb{X}\\hat{\\theta}) = \\vec{0}\\] \\[\\mathbb{X}^T \\mathbb{Y} - \\mathbb{X}^T \\mathbb{X} \\hat{\\theta} = \\vec{0}\\] \\[\\mathbb{X}^T \\mathbb{X} \\hat{\\theta} = \\mathbb{X}^T \\mathbb{Y}\\]\nThis last line is known as the normal equation. Any vector \\(\\theta\\) that minimizes MSE on a dataset must satisfy this equation.\nIf \\(\\mathbb{X}^T \\mathbb{X}\\) is invertible, we can conclude: \\[\\hat{\\theta} = (\\mathbb{X}^T \\mathbb{X})^{-1} \\mathbb{X}^T \\mathbb{Y}\\]\nThis is called the least squares estimate of \\(\\theta\\): it is the value of \\(\\theta\\) that minimizes the squared loss.\nNote that the least squares estimate was derived under the assumption that \\(\\mathbb{X}^T \\mathbb{X}\\) is invertible. This condition holds true when \\(\\mathbb{X}^T \\mathbb{X}\\) is full column rank, which, in turn, happens when \\(\\mathbb{X}\\) is full column rank. We will explore the consequences of this fact in lab and homework."

    "text": "12.5 Evaluating Model Performance\nOur geometric view of multiple Linear regression has taken us far! We have identified the optimal set of parameter values to minimize MSE in a model of multiple features.\nNow, we want to understand how well our fitted model performs. One measure of model performance is the Root Mean Squared Error, or RMSE. The RMSE is simply the square root of MSE. Taking the square root converts the value back into the original, non-squared units of \\(y_i\\), which is useful for understanding the model’s performance. A low RMSE indicates more “accurate” predictions – that there is lower average loss across the dataset.\n\\[\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}\\]\nWhen working with SLR, we generated plots of the residuals against a single feature to understand the behavior of residuals. When working with several features in multiple Linear regression, it no longer makes sense to consider a single feature in our residual plots. Instead, multiple Linear regression is evaluated by making plots of the residuals against the predicted values. As was the case with SLR, a multiple Linear model performs well if its residual plot shows no patterns.\n\nFor SLR, we used the correlation coefficient to capture the association between the target variable and a single feature variable. In a multiple Linear setting, we will need a performance metric that can account for multiple features at once. Multiple \\(R^2\\), also called the coefficient of determination, is the ratio of the variance of the predicted values \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) to the variance of the true values \\(y_i\\). It can be interpreted as the proportion of variance in the observations that is explained by the model.\n\\[R^2 = \\frac{\\text{variance of } \\hat{y}_i}{\\text{variance of } y_i} = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\hat{y}}}{\\sigma^2_y}\\]\nAs we add more features, our fitted values tend to become closer and closer to our actual values. Thus, \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) increases."
