<p>Up until this point in the class , we’ve focused on <strong>regression</strong> tasks - that is, predicting an <em>unbounded numerical quantity</em> from a given dataset. We discussed optimization, feature engineering, and regularization all in the context of performing regression to predict some quantity.</p>
<p>Now that we have this deep understanding of the modeling process, let’s expand our knowledge of possible modeling tasks.</p>
<section id="classification" class="level2" data-number="22.1">
<h2 data-number="22.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="classification"><span class="header-section-number">22.1</span> Classification</h2>
<p>In the next two lectures, we’ll tackle the task of <strong>classification</strong>. A classification problem aims to classify data into <em>categories</em>. Unlike in regression, where we predicted a numeric output, classification involves predicting some <strong>categorical variable</strong>, or <strong>response</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Examples of classification tasks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predicting which team won from its turnover percentage</li>
<li>Predicting the day of the week of a meal from the total restaurant bill</li>
<li>Predicting the model of car from its horsepower</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of different types of classification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Binary classification</strong>: classify data into two classes, and responses <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are either 0 or 1</li>
<li><strong>Multiclass classification</strong>: classify data into multiple classes (e.g., image labeling, next word in a sentence, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can further combine multiple related classfication predictions (e.g., translation, voice recognition, etc.) to tackle complex problems through structured prediction tasks.</p>
<p>In Data 100, we will mostly deal with <strong>binary classification</strong>, where we are attempting to classify data into one of two classes.</p>
<section id="modeling-process" class="level3" data-number="22.1.1">
<h3 data-number="22.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modeling-process"><span class="header-section-number">22.1.1</span> Modeling Process</h3>
<p>To build a classification model, we need to modify our modeling workflow slightly. Recall that in regression we:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Created a design matrix of numeric features</li>
<li>Defined our model as a linear combination of these numeric features</li>
<li>Used the model to output numeric predictions</li>
</ol>
<p>In classification, however, we no longer want to output numeric predictions; instead, we want to predict the class to which a datapoint belongs. This means that we need to update our workflow. To build a classification model, we will:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a design matrix of numeric features.</li>
<li>Define our model as a linear combination of these numeric features, transformed by a non-linear <strong>sigmoid function</strong>. This outputs a numeric quantity.</li>
<li>Apply a <strong>decision rule</strong> to interpret the outputted quantity and decide a classification.</li>
<li>Output a predicted class.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two key differences: as we’ll soon see, we need to incorporate a non-linear transformation to capture the non-linear relationships hidden in our data. We do so by applying the sigmoid function to a linear combination of the features. Secondly, we must apply a decision rule to convert the numeric quantities computed by our model into an actual class prediction. This can be as simple as saying that any datapoint with a feature greater than some number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> belongs to Class 1.</p>

<p>Throughout this lecture, we will work with the <code>games</code> dataset, which contains information about games played in the NBA basketball league. Our goal will be to use a basketball team’s <code>"GOAL_DIFF"</code> to predict whether or not a given team won their game (<code>"WON"</code>). If a team wins their game, we’ll say they belong to Class 1. If they lose, they belong to Class 0.</p>
<p>For those who are curious, <code>"GOAL_DIFF"</code> represents the difference in successful field goal percentages between the two competing teams.</p>

<p>Let’s visualize the relationship between <code>"GOAL_DIFF"</code> and <code>"WON"</code> using the Seaborn function <code>sns.stripplot</code>. A strip plot automatically introduces a small amount of random noise to <strong>jitter</strong> the data. Recall that all values in the <code>"WON"</code> column are either 1 (won) or 0 (lost) – if we were to directly plot them without jittering, we would see severe overplotting.</p>

<p>This dataset is unlike anything we’ve seen before – our target variable contains only two unique values! (Remember that each y value is either 0 or 1; the plot above jitters the y data slightly for ease of reading.)</p>
<p>The regression models we have worked with always assumed that we were attempting to predict a continuous target. If we apply a linear regression model to this dataset, something strange happens.</p>

<p>The linear regression fit follows the data as closely as it can. However, this approach has a key flaw - the predicted output, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span>, can be outside the range of possible classes (there are predictions above 1 and below 0). This means that the output can’t always be interpreted (what does it mean to predict a class of -2.3?).</p>
<p>Our usual linear regression framework won’t work here. Instead, we’ll need to get more creative.</p>

<h3 data-number="22.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="graph-of-averages"><span class="header-section-number">22.2.1</span> Graph of Averages</h3>
<p>Back in <a href="https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/08/1/Applying_a_Function_to_a_Column.html#example-prediction">Data 8</a>, you gradually built up to the concept of linear regression by using the <strong>graph of averages</strong>. Before you knew the mathematical underpinnings of the regression line, you took a more intuitive approach: you bucketed the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> data into bins of common values, then computed the average <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> for all datapoints in the same bin. The result gave you the insight needed to derive the regression fit.</p>
<p>Let’s take the same approach as we grapple with our new classification task. In the cell below, we 1) bucket the <code>"GOAL_DIFF"</code> data into bins of similar values and 2) compute the average <code>"WON"</code> value of all datapoints in a bin.</p>

<p>Interesting: our result is certainly not like the straight line produced by finding the graph of averages for a linear relationship. We can make two observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>All predictions on our line are between 0 and 1</li>
<li>The predictions are <strong>non-linear</strong>, following a rough “S” shape</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s think more about what we’ve just done.</p>
<p>To find the average <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> value for each bin, we computed:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1 \text{(\# Y = 1 in bin)} + 0 \text{(\# Y = 0 in bin)}}{\text{\# datapoints in bin}} = \frac{\text{\# Y = 1 in bin}}{\text{\# datapoints in bin}} = P(\text{Y = 1} | \text{bin})\]</span></p>
<p>This is simply the probability of a datapoint in that bin belonging to Class 1! This aligns with our observation from earlier: all of our predictions lie between 0 and 1, just as we would expect for a probability.</p>
<p>Our graph of averages was really modeling the probability, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, that a datapoint belongs to Class 1, or essentially that <span class="math inline">\(\text{Y = 1}\)</span> for a particular value of <span class="math inline">\(\text{x}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ p = P(Y = 1 | \text{ x} )\]</span></p>
<p>In logistic regression, we have a new modeling goal. We want to model the <strong>probability that a particular datapoint belongs to Class 1</strong> by approximating the S-shaped curve we plotted above. However, we’ve only learned about linear modeling techniques like Linear Regression and OLS.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-sigmoid-function" class="level3" data-number="22.2.2">
<h3 data-number="22.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-sigmoid-function"><span class="header-section-number">22.2.2</span> The Sigmoid Function</h3>
<p>Let’s start by identifying an S-shaped function that maps (<span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>) inputs to (0,1) outputs—the <strong>sigmoid (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>) function</strong>. It is also known as the logistic function or the inverse logit function.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}\]</span></p>
<center>
<img src="images/sigmoid.png" alt="log_reg" width="400">
</center>
<p>As it turns out, the logistic regression model fits a sigmoid function to the data. We can also shift and scale the sigmoid function just as if we were transforming any other function to fit our data: <span class="math display">\[\sigma(\theta_0+\theta x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\theta_0+\theta_1x)}}\]</span></p>
<p>Note that our input to the sigmoid function here looks exactly like simple linear regression! And just like in ordinary least squares, we’re not limited to one input: <span class="math display">\[P(Y=1 \mid x) = \sigma(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 ) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2)}}\]</span></p>

<p>Let’s now generalize our model to multiple inputs rather than just one or two inputs. The probability of a datapoint belonging to Class 1 is: <span class="math display">\[P(Y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x^T \theta}}  = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \theta_p x_p)}}\]</span></p>
<p>To predict a probability using the logistic regression model, we:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Compute a linear combination of the features, <span class="math inline">\(x^{\top}\theta\)</span></li>
<li>Apply the sigmoid activation function, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(x^{\top} \theta)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our main takeaway from this section is that we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model the <strong>probability <span class="math inline">\(P(Y = 1 | x)\)</span></strong> using a <strong>sigmoid transformation</strong> of a <strong>linear model</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, the estimated probability that the response is 1 given the features <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, is equal to the logistic function <span class="math inline">\(\sigma()\)</span> at the value <span class="math inline">\(x^{\top}\theta\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\hat{P}_{\theta}(Y = 1 | x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x^{\top}\theta}}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>More commonly, the logistic regression model is written as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\hat{P}_{\theta}(Y = 1 | x) = \sigma(x^{\top}\theta)
\end{align}\]</span></p>

<p>Suppose we want to predict the probability that a team wins a game, given <code>"GOAL_DIFF"</code> (first feature) and the <strong>number of free throws</strong> (second feature). Let’s say we fit a logistic regression model (with no intercept) using the training data and estimate the optimal parameters. Now we want to predict the probability that a new team with a <code>"GOAL_DIFF"</code> of 15 and 1 free throw per game will win their game.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}

<p>Let’s focus on the simple logistic regression model with just one input: <span class="math display">\[P(Y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\theta_0+\theta_1x)}}\]</span></p>
<p>Recall that in simple linear regression (<span class="math inline">\(y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x\)</span>), we interpret <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span> as the change in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> for a one-unit increase in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. However, in logistic regression, the change in the predicted outcome is not constant for every one-unit increase in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> since the sigmoid function is nonlinear (not a straight line). To make interpretation a little easier, we can isolate the linear combination <span class="math inline">\(\theta_0 + \theta_1\)</span> using some algebra: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
&amp; P(Y=1 \mid x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x)}} \\
&amp; 1+e^{-(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x)} = \frac{1}{P(Y=1 \mid x)} \\
&amp; e^{-(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x)} = \frac{1}{P(Y=1 \mid x)} - 1 \\
&amp; e^{-(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x)} = \frac{1 - P(Y=1 \mid x)}{P(Y=1 \mid x)} \\
&amp; e^{\theta_0 + \theta_1 x} = \frac{P(Y=1 \mid x)}{1 - P(Y=1 \mid x)} \\
&amp; \theta_0 + \theta_1 x = \log \left( \frac{P(Y=1 \mid x)}{1 - P(Y=1 \mid x)} \right)
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>We have just derived that as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> increases by one, <span class="math inline">\(\log \left( \frac{P(Y=1 \mid x)}{1 - P(Y=1 \mid x)} \right)\)</span> increases by <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span>. Does this really have a meaningful interpretation?</p>
<p>To help with our interpretation, consider the expression: “Cal has 10 to 1 odds of winning the game.” These <span class="math inline">\(10:1\)</span> odds means that <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{Cal wins}) = 10 \cdot P(\text{Cal loses})\)</span>. The <strong>odds</strong> is defined as the probability of a datapoint Y belonging to Class 1 divided by the probability of it belonging to Class 0.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{odds} = \frac{P(Y=1|x)}{P(Y=0|x)} = \frac{P(Y=1 \mid x)}{1 - P(Y=1 \mid x)} \]</span></p>
<p>Great! Now we have a much more meaningful interpretation of the logistic regression coefficients as <strong>log-odds</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every one-unit increase in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\text{log}(\text{Odds}(Y=1|x))\)</span> increases by <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 data-number="22.3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linearity"><span class="header-section-number">22.3.2</span> Linearity</h3>
<p>To summarize, probability is a <strong>nonlinear</strong> function of the features because <span class="math inline">\(P(Y=1|x) =\sigma(x^{\top}\theta)\)</span> applies a nonlinear sigmoid transformation to <span class="math inline">\(x^{\top}\theta\)</span>. However, we have just found that the log-odds are a <strong>linear</strong> function with respect to the <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>’s. Namely, <span class="math inline">\(\text{log}(\text{Odds}(Y=1|x)) = x^{\top}\theta\)</span>. Indeed, this means there is linearity in the logistic regression model! This linearity in the log-odds leads to a linear decision boundary between Class 0 and Class 1, which we will explore more in the next section.</p>

<h2 data-number="22.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="decision-boundaries"><span class="header-section-number">22.4</span> Decision Boundaries</h2>
<p>In logistic regression, we model the <em>probability</em> that a datapoint belongs to Class 1.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/log_reg_summary.png" alt="log_reg_summary" width="800">
</center>
<p><br> In this lecture, we developed the logistic regression model to predict that probability, but the model itself does not classify whether a prediction is Class 0 or Class 1.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ p = \hat{P}_\theta(Y=1 | x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x^{\top}\theta}}\]</span></p>
<p>A <strong>decision rule</strong> tells us how to convert model outputs into classifications. We commonly make decision rules by specifying a <strong>threshold</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. If the predicted probability is greater than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, predict Class 1. Otherwise, predict Class 0.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat y = \text{classify}(x) = \begin{cases}
        1, &amp; p \ge T\\
        0, &amp; p &lt; T
    \end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>The threshold is often set to <span class="math inline">\(T = 0.5\)</span>, but <em>not always</em>. We’ll discuss why we might want to use other thresholds <span class="math inline">\(T \neq 0.5\)</span> later in this lecture and the next.</p>
<p>Using our decision rule, we can define a <strong>decision boundary</strong> as the “line” that splits the data into classes based on its features. For logistic regression, since we are working in <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> dimensions, the decision boundary is a <strong>hyperplane</strong>—a linear combination of the features in <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-dimensions—and we can recover it from the log-odds.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we decide to classify all new data points with <span class="math inline">\(P(Y=1|x) \geq 0.5\)</span> as Class 1, and all points with <span class="math inline">\(P(Y=1|x) &lt; 0.5\)</span> as Class 0. In other words, we choose 0.5 as our chosen probability threshold. We can calculate our log-odds as follows: <span class="math display">\[\text{log}(\text{Odds}(Y=1|x))=\log \left( \frac{P(Y=1 \mid x)}{1 - P(Y=1 \mid x)} \right) = \log\left(\frac{0.5}{1 - 0.5}\right) = \log(1) = 0\]</span> This is the same as labeling all points with <span class="math inline">\(\text{log}(\text{Odds}(Y=1|x)) \geq 0\)</span> as Class 1, and all points with <span class="math inline">\(\text{log}(\text{Odds}(Y=1|x)) &lt; 0\)</span> as Class 0. Since <span class="math inline">\(\text{log}(\text{Odds}(Y=1|x)) = x^{\top}\theta\)</span>, we have just found that <span class="math display">\[\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \theta_p x_p = 0\]</span> is our <strong>linear decision boundary</strong> for classification given a threshold of 0.5.</p>
<p>For a model with 2 features, the decision boundary is a line in terms of its features. To make it easier to visualize, we’ve included an example of a 1-dimensional and a 2-dimensional decision boundary below. Notice how the decision boundary predicted by our logistic regression model perfectly separates the points into two classes. Here the color is the <em>predicted</em> class, rather than the true class.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/decision_boundary.png" alt="decision_boundary" width="800">
</center>
<p>In real life, however, that is often not the case, and we often see some overlap between points of different classes across the decision boundary. The <em>true</em> classes of the 2D data are shown below:</p>
<center>
<img src="images/decision_boundary_true.png" alt="decision_boundary_true" width="400">
</center>
<p>As you can see, the decision boundary predicted by our logistic regression does not perfectly separate the two classes. There’s a “muddled” region near the decision boundary where our classifier predicts the wrong class. What would the data have to look like for the classifier to make perfect predictions?</p>

<p>To build some intuition for logistic regression, let’s look at an introductory example to classification: the coin flip. Suppose we observe some outcomes of a coin flip (1 = Heads, 0 = Tails).</p>

<p>A reasonable model is to assume all flips are IID (independent and identically distributed). In other words, each flip has the same probability of returning a 1 (or heads). Let’s define a parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, the probability that the next flip is a heads. We will use this parameter to inform our decision for <span class="math inline">\(\hat y\)</span> (predicting either 0 or 1) of the next flip. If <span class="math inline">\(\theta \ge 0.5, \hat y = 1, \text{else } \hat y = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>You may be inclined to say <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> is the best choice for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. However, notice that we made no assumption about the coin itself. The coin may be biased, so we should make our decision based only on the data. We know that exactly <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4}{10}\)</span> of the flips were heads, so we might guess <span class="math inline">\(\hat \theta = 0.4\)</span>. In the next section, we will mathematically prove why this is the best possible estimate.</p>

<p>Let’s call the result of the coin flip a random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. This is a Bernoulli random variable with two outcomes. <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> has the following distribution:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(Y = y) = \begin{cases}
        p, \text{if }  y=1\\
        1 - p, \text{if }  y=0

<p><span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is unknown to us. But we can find the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that makes the data we observed the most <em>likely</em>.</p>
<p>The probability of observing 4 heads and 6 tails follows the binomial distribution.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\binom{10}{4} (p)^4 (1-p)^6\]</span></p>
<p>We define the <strong>likelihood</strong> of obtaining our observed data as a quantity <em>proportional</em> to the probability above. To find it, simply multiply the probabilities of obtaining each coin flip.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(p)^{4} (1-p)^6\]</span></p>
<p>The technique known as <strong>maximum likelihood estimation</strong> finds the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that maximizes the above likelihood. You can find this maximum by taking the derivative of the likelihood, but we’ll provide a more intuitive graphical solution.</p>

<p>More generally, the likelihood for some Bernoulli(<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(Y = y) = \begin{cases}
        1, \text{with probability }  p\\
        0, \text{with probability }  1 - p
    \end{cases} \]</span></p>
<p>Equivalently, this can be written in a compact way:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(Y=y) = p^y(1-p)^{1-y}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(y = 1\)</span>, this reads <span class="math inline">\(P(Y=y) = p\)</span></li>
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span>, this reads <span class="math inline">\(P(Y=y) = (1-p)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In our example, a Bernoulli random variable is analogous to a single data point (e.g., one instance of a basketball team winning or losing a game). All together, our <code>games</code> data consists of many IID Bernoulli(<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) random variables. To find the likelihood of independent events in succession, simply multiply their likelihoods.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\prod_{i=1}^{n} p^{y_i} (1-p)^{1-y_i}\]</span></p>
<p>As with the coin example, we want to find the parameter <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that maximizes this likelihood. Earlier, we gave an intuitive graphical solution, but let’s take the derivative of the likelihood to find this maximum.</p>
<p>At a first glance, this derivative will be complicated! We will have to use the product rule, followed by the chain rule. Instead, we can make an observation that simplifies the problem.</p>
<p>Finding the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that maximizes <span class="math display">\[\prod_{i=1}^{n} p^{y_i} (1-p)^{1-y_i}\]</span> is equivalent to the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that maximizes <span class="math display">\[\text{log}(\prod_{i=1}^{n} p^{y_i} (1-p)^{1-y_i})\]</span></p>
<p>This is because <span class="math inline">\(\text{log}\)</span> is a strictly <em>increasing</em> function. It won’t change the maximum or minimum of the function it was applied to. From <span class="math inline">\(\text{log}\)</span> properties, <span class="math inline">\(\text{log}(a*b)\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(\text{log}(a) + \text{log}(b)\)</span>. We can apply this to our equation above to get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\underset{p}{\text{argmax}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{log}(p^{y_i} (1-p)^{1-y_i})\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[= \underset{p}{\text{argmax}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{log}(p^{y_i}) + \text{log}((1-p)^{1-y_i}))\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[= \underset{p}{\text{argmax}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i\text{log}(p) + (1-y_i)\text{log}(1-p))\]</span></p>
<p>We can add a constant factor of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> out front. It won’t affect the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that maximizes our likelihood.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[=\underset{p}{\text{argmax}}  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i\text{log}(p) + (1-y_i)\text{log}(1-p)\]</span></p>
<p>One last “trick” we can do is change this to a minimization problem by negating the result. This works because we are dealing with a <em>concave</em> function, which can be made <em>convex</em>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[= \underset{p}{\text{argmin}} -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i\text{log}(p) + (1-y_i)\text{log}(1-p)\]</span></p>
<p>Now let’s say that we have data that are independent with different probability <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span>. Then, we would want to find the <span class="math inline">\(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n\)</span> that maximize <span class="math display">\[\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i^{y_i} (1-p_i)^{1-y_i}\]</span></p>
<p>Setting up and simplifying the optimization problems as we did above, we ultimately want to find:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[= \underset{p}{\text{argmin}} -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i\text{log}(p_i) + (1-y_i)\text{log}(1-p_i)\]</span></p>
<p>For logistic regression, <span class="math inline">\(p_i = \sigma(x^{\top}\theta)\)</span>. Plugging that in, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[= \underset{p}{\text{argmin}} -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i\text{log}(\sigma(x^{\top}\theta)) + (1-y_i)\text{log}(1-\sigma(x^{\top}\theta))\]</span></p>
<p>This is exactly our average cross-entropy loss minimization problem from before!</p>
<p>Why did we do all this complicated math? We have shown that <em>minimizing</em> cross-entropy loss is equivalent to <em>maximizing</em> the likelihood of the training data.</p>
<ul>
<li>By minimizing cross-entropy loss, we are choosing the model parameters that are “most likely” for the data we observed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this is under the assumption that all data is drawn independently from the same logistic regression model with parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. In fact, many of the model + loss combinations we’ve seen can be motivated using MLE (e.g., OLS, Ridge Regression, etc.). In probability and ML classes, you’ll get the chance to explore MLE further.</p>
