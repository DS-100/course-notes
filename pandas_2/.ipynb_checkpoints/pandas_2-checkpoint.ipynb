Because of this, `pandas` will simply omit these columns when it performs the aggregation on the DataFrame. Since this happens implicitly, without the user specifying that these columns should be ignored, it's easy to run into troubling situations where columns are removed without the programmer noticing. It is better coding practice to select *only* the columns we care about before performing the aggregation."
