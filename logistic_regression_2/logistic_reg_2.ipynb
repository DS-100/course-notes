We'll discuss decision boundaries that help inform the classification of a particular prediction and learn about linear separability. Then, we'll pick up from last lecture's discussion of cross-entropy loss, study a few of its pitfalls, and learn potential remedies. We will also provide an implementation of `sklearn`'s logistic regression model. Lastly, we'll return to decision rules and discuss metrics that allow us to determine our model's performance in different scenarios. \n",

In doing so, we'll focus on how these thresholding decisions affect the behavior of our model. We will learn various evaluation metrics useful for binary classification, and apply them to our study of logistic regression.\n",
