    "Data science is an interdisciplinary field with a variety of applications. The field is rapidly evolving; many of the key technical underpinnings in modern-day data science have been popularized during the early 21^st^ century.\n",
    "\n",
    "A true mastery of data science requires a deep theoretical understanding and strong grasp of domain expertise. This course will help you build on the former -- specifically, the foundation of your technical knowledge. To do so, we've organized concepts in Data 100 around the **data science lifecycle**: an iterative process that encompasses the various statistical and computational building blocks of data science. \n",

In the field of medicine, they may ask whether some patients are more likely than others to benefit from a treatment. \n",
