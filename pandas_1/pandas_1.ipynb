    "The `pandas` library is enormous and contains many useful functions. Here is a link to its [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/). We certainly don't expect you to memorize each and every method of the library, and we will give you a reference sheet for exams.\n",

    "The introductory Data 100 `pandas` lectures will provide a high-level view of the key data structures and methods that will form the foundation of your `pandas` knowledge. A goal of this course is to help you build your familiarity with the real-world programming practice of ... Googling! Answers to your questions can be found in documentation, Stack Overflow, etc. Being able to search for, read, and implement documentation is an important life skill for any data scientist. \n",
