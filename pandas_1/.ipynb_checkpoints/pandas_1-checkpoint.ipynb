    "The most fundamental way to manipulate a DataFrame is to extract a subset of rows and columns. This is called **slicing**. We will do so with three primary methods of the DataFrame class:\n",

    "\n",
    "The `.loc` operator selects rows and columns in a DataFrame by their row and column label(s), respectively. The **row label** (commonly referred to as the **index**) is the bold text on the far *left* of a DataFrame, while the **column label** is the text found at the *top* of a DataFrame. By default, row labels in `pandas` are the sequential list of integers beginning from 0. The column labels in our `elections` DataFrame are the column names themselves: `Year`, `Candidate`, `Party`, `Popular Vote`, `Result`, and `%`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`.loc` lets us grab data by specifying the appropriate row and column label(s) where the data exists. The row labels are the first argument to the `.loc` function; the column labels are the second. For example, to select the the row labeled `0` and the column labeled `Candidate` from our `elections` DataFrame we can write:"
