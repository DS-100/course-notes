        "Suppose we generate a set of random data, like a random sample from some population. A random variable is a numerical function of the randomness in the data. It is *random* from the randomness of the sample; it is *variable* because its exact value depends on how this random sample came out. We typically denote random variables with uppercase letters, such as $X$ or $Y$. \n",
        "\n",
        "To give a concrete example: say we draw a random sample $s$ of size 3 from all students enrolled in Data 100. We might then define the random variable $X$ to be the number of Data Science majors in this sample.\n",

        "\n",
        "The **distribution** of a random variable $X$ describes how the total probability of 100% is split over all possible values that $X$ could take. If $X$ is a **discrete random variable** with a finite number of possible values, define its distribution by stating the probability of $X$ taking on some specific value, $x$, for all possible values of $x$.\n",

        "\n",
        "Often, we will work with multiple random variables at the same time. In our example above, we could have defined the random variable $X$ as the number of Data Science majors in our sample of students, and the variable $Y$ as the number of Statistics majors in the sample. For any two random variables $X$ and $Y$:\n",
        "\n",

That is, $X$ and $Y$ take on the same set of possible values, and each of these possible values is taken with the same probability. On any specific sample $s$, identically distributed variables do *not* necessarily share the same value.\n",

        "\n",
        "Often, it is easier to describe a random variable using some numerical summary, rather than fully defining its distribution. These numerical summaries are numbers that characterize some properties of the random variable. Because they give a \"summary\" of how the variable tends to behave, they are *not* random – think of them as a static number that describes a certain property of the random variable. In Data 100, we will focus our attention on the expectation and variance of a random variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Expectation\n",
        "The **expectation** of a random variable $X$ is the weighted average of the values of $X$, where the weights are the probabilities of each value occurring. To compute the expectation, we find each value $x$ that the variable could possibly take, weight by the probability of the variable taking on each specific value, and sum across all possible values of $x$. \n",

        "$$\\mathbb{E}[X+Y] = \\mathbb{E}[X] + \\mathbb{E}[Y]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "### Variance\n",
        "The **variance** of a random variable is a measure of its chance error. It is defined as the expected squared deviation from the expectation of $X$. Put more simply, variance asks: how far does $X$ typically vary from its average value? What is the spread of $X$'s distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\text{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[(X-\\mathbb{E}[X])^2]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "If we expand the square and use properties of expectation, we can re-express this statement as the **computational formula for variance**. This form is often more convenient to use when computing the variance of a variable by hand.\n",

        "\n",
        "How do we compute the expectation of $X^2$? Any function of a random variable is *also* a random variable – that means that by squaring $X$, we've created a new random variable. To compute $\\mathbb{E}[X^2]$, we can simply apply our definition of expectation to the random variable $X^2$.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The full proof of this fact can be found using the definition of variance. As general intuition, consider that $aX+b$ scales the variable $X$ by a factor of $a$, then shifts the distribution of $X$ by $b$ units. \n",
        "\n",
        "* Shifting the distribution by $b$ *does not* impact the *spread* of the distribution. Thus, $\\text{Var}(aX+b) = \\text{Var}(aX)$.\n",

        "\n",
        "This last term is of special significance. We define the **covariance** of two random variables as the expected product of deviations from expectation. Put more simply, covariance is a generalization of variance to *two* random variables: $\\text{Cov}(X, X) = \\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mathbb{E}[X])^2] = \\text{Var}(X)$.\n",

        "\n",
        "It turns out we've been quietly using covariance for some time now! If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $\\text{Cov}(X, Y) =0$ and $r(X, Y) = 0$. Note, however, that the converse is not always true: $X$ and $Y$ could have $\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = r(X, Y) = 0$ but not be independent.
