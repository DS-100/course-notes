As such, the domain or input of our random variable is all possible (random) outcomes in a *sample space*, and its range or output is the number line. We typically denote random variables with uppercase letters, such as $X$ or $Y$. \n",

The methods shown above -- a table of all samples $s, X(s)$, distribution table $P(X=x)$, and histograms -- are all definitions that *fully describe* a random variable. Often, it is easier to describe a random variable using some *numerical summary* rather than fully defining its distribution. These numerical summaries are numbers that characterize some properties of the random variable. Because they give a \"summary\" of how the variable tends to behave, they are *not* random – think of them as a static number that describes a certain property of the random variable. In Data 100, we will focus our attention on the expectation and variance of a random variable.\n",

        "We want to emphasize that the expectation is a *number*, not a random variable. Expectation is a generalization of the average, and it has the same units as the random variable. It is also the center of gravity of the probability distribution histogram, meaning if we simulate the variable many times, it is the long-run average of the random variable.\n",

        "The **variance** of a random variable is a measure of its chance error. It is defined as the expected squared deviation from the expectation of $X$.
