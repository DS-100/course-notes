    "So far in the course, we have made our way through the entire data science lifecycle: we learned how to load and explore a dataset, formulate questions, and use the tools of prediction and inference to come up with answers. For the remaining weeks of the semester, we are going to make a second pass through the lifecycle, this time with a different set of tools, ideas, and abstractions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Databases\n",
    "With this goal in mind, let's go back to the very beginning of the lifecycle. We first started our work in data analysis by looking at the `pandas` library, which offered us powerful tools to manipulate tabular data stored in (primarily) CSV files. CSVs work well when analyzing relatively small datasets (less than 10GB) that are unchanging (static) and don't need to be shared across many users. In research and industry, however, data scientists often need to access enormous bodies of data that cannot be easily stored in a CSV format. Collaborating with others when working with CSVs can also be tricky — a real-world data scientist may run into problems when multiple users try to make modifications or more dire security issues arise regarding who should and should not have access to the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **database** is a large, organized collection of data. Databases are administered by **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**, which are software systems that **store**, **manage**, and **facilitate access** to one or more databases. Databases help mitigate many of the issues that come with using CSVs for data storage: they provide reliable storage that can survive system crashes or disk failures, are optimized to compute on data that does not fit into memory, and contain special data structures to improve performance. Using databases rather than CSVs offers further benefits from the standpoint of data management. A DBMS can apply settings that configure how data is organized, block certain data anomalies (for example, enforcing non-negative weights or ages), and determine who is allowed access to the data. It can also ensure safe concurrent operations where multiple users reading and writing to the database will not lead to fatal errors. Below, you can see the functionality of the different types of data storage and management architectures. In data science, common large-scale DBMS systems used are Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, Databricks, Microsoft SQL Server, and more. To learn more about these, consider taking [Data 101](https://www.data101.org/sp24/)!\n",

    "As you may have guessed, we can't use our usual `pandas` methods to work with data in a database. Instead, we'll turn to Structured Query Language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro to SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured Query Language**, or **SQL** (commonly pronounced \"sequel,\" though this is the subject of [fierce debate](https://patorjk.com/blog/2012/01/26/pronouncing-sql-s-q-l-or-sequel/)), is a special programming language designed to communicate with databases, and it is the dominant language/technology for working with data. You may have encountered it in classes like CS 61A or Data C88C before, and you likely will encounter it in the future. It is a language of tables: all inputs and outputs are tables. Unlike Python, it is a **declarative programming language** – this means that rather than writing the exact logic needed to complete a task, a piece of SQL code \"declares\" what the desired final output should be and leaves the program to determine what logic should be implemented. This logic differs depending on the SQL code itself or on the system it's running on (ie. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/), etc.). Most systems don’t follow the standards, and every system you work with will be a little different. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of Data 100, we use **SQLite** or **DuckDB**. SQLite is an easy-to-use library that allows users to directly manipulate a database file or an in-memory database with a simplified version of SQL. It's commonly used to store data for small apps on mobile devices and is optimized for simplicity and speed of simple data tasks. DuckDB is an easy-to-use library that lets you directly manipulate a database file, collection of table formatted files (e.g., CSV), or in-memory `pandas` `DataFrame`s using a **more complete version of SQL**. It's optimized for simplicity and speed of advanced data analysis tasks and is becoming increasingly popular for data analysis tasks on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to reiterate that SQL is an entirely different language from Python. However, Python *does* have special engines that allow us to run SQL code in a Jupyter notebook. While this is typically not how SQL is used outside of an educational setting, we will use this workflow to illustrate how SQL queries are constructed using the tools we've already worked with this semester. You will learn more about how to run SQL queries in Jupyter in an upcoming lab and homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax below will seem unfamiliar to you; for now, just focus on understanding the output displayed. We will clarify the SQL code in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we'll look at a database called `example_duck.db` and connect to it using DuckDB."

    "**Every** SQL query must include both a `SELECT` and `FROM` statement. Intuitively, this makes sense — we know that we'll want to extract some piece of information from the table; to do so, we also need to indicate what table we want to consider. \n",
    "\n",

    "#### SQL Style Conventions\n",
    "And just like that, we've already written two SQL queries. There are a few things to note in the queries above. Firstly, notice that every \"verb\" is written in uppercase. It is convention to write SQL operations in capital letters, but your code will run just fine even if you choose to keep things in lowercase. Second, the query above separates each statement with a new line. SQL queries are not impacted by whitespace within the query; this means that SQL code is typically written with a new line after each statement to make things more readable. The semicolon (`;`) indicates the end of a query. There are some \"flavors\" of SQL in which a query will not run if no semicolon is present; however, in Data 100, the SQL version we will use works with or without an ending semicolon. Queries in these notes will end with semicolons to build up good habits.\n",
