    "In data science, understanding characteristics of a population starts with having quality data to investigate. While it is often impossible to collect all the data describing a population, we can overcome this by properly sampling from the population. In this note, we will discuss appropriate techniques for sampling from populations. \n",

    "## Censuses and Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "In general: a **census** is “a complete count or survey of a **population**, typically recording various details of **individuals**.”\n",
    "An example is the U.S. Decennial Census which was held in April 2020. It counts *every person* living in all 50 states, DC, and US territories, not just citizens. Participation is required by law (it is mandated by the U.S. Constitution). Important uses include the allocation of Federal funds, congressional representation, and drawing congressional and state legislative districts. The census is composed of a **survey** mailed to different housing addresses in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **survey** is a set of questions. An example is workers sampling individuals and households. What is asked and how it is asked can affect how the respondent answers or even whether or not they answer in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "While censuses are great, it is often very difficult and expensive to survey everyone in a population. Imagine the amount of resources, money, time, and energy the U.S. spent on the 2020 Census. While this does give us more accurate information about the population, it's often infeasible to execute. Thus, we usually survey a subset of the population instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **sample** is (usually) a subset of the population that is often used to make inferences about the population. If our sample is a good representation of our population, then we can use it to glean useful information at a lower cost. That being said, how the sample is drawn will affect the reliability of such inferences. Two common sources of error in sampling are **chance error**, where random samples can vary from what is expected in any direction, and  **bias**, which is a systematic error in one direction. Biases can be the result of many things, for example, our sampling scheme or survey methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define some useful vocabulary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Population**: The group that you want to learn something about.\n",
    "    * **Individuals** in a population are not always people. Other populations include bacteria in your gut (sampled using DNA sequencing), trees of a certain species, small businesses receiving a microloan, or published results in an academic journal or field.\n",
    "* **Sampling Frame**: The list from which the sample is drawn. \n",
    "    * For example, if sampling people, then the sampling frame is the set of all people that could possibly end up in your sample.\n",
    "* **Sample**: Who you actually end up sampling. The sample is therefore a subset of your *sampling frame*.\n",
    "\n",
    "While ideally, these three sets would be exactly the same, they usually aren't in practice. For example, there may be individuals in your sampling frame (and hence, your sample) that are not in your population. And generally, sample sizes are much smaller than population sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sampling_Frames](images/samplingframe.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampling: A Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "The following case study is adapted from *Statistics* by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves, W.W. Norton NY, 1978.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Democratic) went up for re-election against Alf Landon (Republican). As is usual, **polls** were conducted in the months leading up to the election to try and predict the outcome. The *Literary Digest* was a magazine that had successfully predicted the outcome of 5 general elections coming into 1936. In their polling for the 1936 election, they sent out their survey to 10 million individuals whom they found from phone books, lists of magazine subscribers, and lists of country club members. Of the roughly 2.4 million people who filled out the survey, only 43\\% reported they would vote for Roosevelt; thus, the *Digest* predicted that Landon would win.\n",
    "\n",
    "On election day, Roosevelt won in a landslide, winning 61\\% of the popular vote of about 45 million voters. How could the *Digest* have been so wrong with their polling?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the *Literary Digest* sample was not representative of the population. Their sampling frame of people found in phone books, lists of magazine subscribers, and lists of country club members were more affluent and tended to vote Republican. As such, their sampling frame was inherently skewed in Landon's favor. The *Literary Digest* completely overlooked the lion's share of voters who were still suffering through the Great Depression. Furthermore, they had a dismal response rate (about 24\\%); who knows how the other non-respondents would have polled? The *Digest* folded just 18 months after this disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, George Gallup, a rising statistician, also made predictions about the 1936 elections. Despite having a smaller sample size of “only” 50,000 (this is still more than necessary; more on this when we cover the Central Limit Theorem), his estimate that 56\\% of voters would choose Roosevelt was much closer to the actual result (61\\%). Gallup also predicted the *Digest*'s prediction within 1\\% with a sample size of only 3000 people by anticipating the *Digest*'s affluent sampling frame and subsampling those individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampling Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "So what's the moral of the story? Samples, while convenient, are subject to chance error and **bias**. Election polling, in particular, can involve many sources of bias. To name a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Selection bias** systematically excludes (or favors) particular groups. \n",
    "    * Example: the Literary Digest poll excludes people not in phone books.\n",
    "    * How to avoid: Randomly sample, and improve overlap of sampling  frame and population.\n",
    "* **Response/Measurement bias** occurs because people don't always respond truthfully. Survey designers pay special detail to the nature and wording of questions to avoid this type of bias.\n",
    "    * Example: Illegal immigrants might not answer truthfully when asked citizenship questions on the census survey.\n",
    "    * How to avoid: Improve questions. Lots of response bias [subtypes + prevention methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias#:~:text=%5B7%5D-,Types,-%5Bedit%5D).\n",
    "* **Non-response bias** occurs because people don't always respond to survey requests, which can skew responses. \n",
    "    * Example: Only 2.4m out of 10m people responded to the *Literary Digest*'s poll.\n",
    "    * How to avoid: Increase response rate. For example, reduce the number and length of questions, incentivize completion, and follow up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "When sampling, it is essential to focus on the quality of the sample rather than the quantity of the sample. A huge sample size does not fix a bad sampling method. Our main goal is to gather a sample that is representative of the population it came from. In this section, we'll explore the different types of sampling and their pros and cons. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **convenience sample** is whatever you can get ahold of; this type of sampling is *non-random*. Note that haphazard sampling is not necessarily random sampling; there are many potential sources of bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **probability sample**, we provide the **chance** that any specified **set** of individuals will be in the sample (individuals in the population can have different chances of being selected; they don't all have to be uniform), and we sample at random based off this known chance. For this reason, probability samples are also called **random samples**. The randomness provides a few benefits: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Because we know the source probabilities, we can **measure the errors**.\n",
    "* Sampling at random gives us a more representative sample of the population, which **reduces bias**. (Note: this is only the case when the probability distribution we're sampling from is accurate. Random samples using \"bad\" or inaccurate distributions can produce biased estimates of population quantities.)\n",
    "* Probability samples allow us to **estimate** the **bias** and **chance error**, which helps us **quantify uncertainty** (more in a future lecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "The real world is usually more complicated, and we often don't know the initial probabilities. For example, we do not generally know the probability that a given bacterium is in a microbiome sample or whether people will answer when Gallup calls landlines. That being said, still we try to model probability sampling to the best of our ability even when the sampling or measurement process is not fully under our control.\n",
    "    \n",
    "A few common random sampling schemes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **uniform random sample with replacement** is a sample drawn **uniformly** at random **with** replacement.\n",
    "    * Random doesn’t always mean “uniformly at random,” but in this specific context, it does.\n",
    "    * Some individuals in the population might get picked more than once.\n",
    "* A **simple random sample (SRS)** is a sample drawn **uniformly** at random **without** replacement.\n",
    "    * Every individual (and subset of individuals) has the same chance of being selected from the sampling frame.\n",
    "    * Every pair has the same chance as every other pair.\n",
    "    * Every triple has the same chance as every other triple.\n",
    "    * And so on.\n",
    "* A **stratified random sample**, where the sampling frame is divided into non-overlapping **strata** according to chosen characteristics. Then, a simple random sample (SRS) is conducted on each **stratum**, with sample size proportional to stratum size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scheme 1: Probability Sample\n",
    "Suppose we have 3 TA's (**A**rman, **B**oyu, **C**harlie):\n",
    "I decide to sample 2 of them as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I choose A with probability 1.0\n",
    "* I choose either B or C, each with a probability of 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can list all the possible outcomes and their respective probabilities in a table: \n",
    "\n",
    "| Outcome | Probability |\n",
    "| --- | ----------- |\n",
    "| {A, B} | 0.5 |\n",
    "| {A, C} | 0.5 |\n",
    "| {B, C} | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **probability sample** (though not a great one). Of the 3 people in my population, I know the chance of getting each subset. Suppose I’m measuring the average distance TAs live from campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This scheme does not see the entire population!\n",
    "* My estimate using the single sample I take has some chance error depending on if I see AB or AC.\n",
    "* This scheme is biased towards A’s response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scheme 2: Simple Random Sample?\n",
    "Consider the following sampling scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A class roster has 1200 students listed alphabetically.\n",
    "* Pick one of the first 10 students on the list at random (e.g. Student 8).\n",
    "* To create your sample, take that student and every 10th student listed after that (e.g. Students 8, 18, 28, 38, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Is this a probability sample?</summary>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Yes. For a sample [n, n + 10, n + 20, …, n + 1190], where 1 <= n <= 10, the probability of that sample is 1/10. Otherwise, the probability is 0. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Only 10 possible samples!\n",

    "\n",

    "  <summary>Does each student have the same probability of being selected?</summary>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Yes. Each student is chosen with a probability of 1/10. Since there are only 10 possible samples, each sample is equally likely, and each student is in exactly 1 of the 10 samples, there is exactly 1 out of 10 possible outcomes where any specific student is selected.\n",

    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>Is this a simple random sample?</summary>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  No. The chance of selecting (8, 18) is 1/10; the chance of selecting (8, 9) is 0.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scheme 3: Stratified Random Sampling\n",
    "Suppose you want to interview a representative sample of **12 students** enrolled in Data 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose there are **1,200 students** in Data 100.\n",

    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-representative Sampling and Post-stratification\n",
    "Often times, for whatever reason, we cannot obtain a truly representative sample. This often happens in industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When conducting customer surveys, not everyone responds or provides contact info\n",
    "* When polling for election prediction, not all voters are reachable or want to talk to you\n",
    "* When conducting clinical trials, patients have to voluntarily join a trial, and it is possible that people who volunteer to join a clinical trial differ in some way from the average patient who the treatment is for, and thus they are not representative of the population the trial is meant to study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Non-representative Sampling Scheme\n",
    "* A class has 1200 students enrolled in it, 100 of whom are graduate students, and the other 1100 of whom are undergraduate students.\n",
    "* The professor is trying to understand the proportion of students who are enjoying the class, and they are surveying the 20 students who are in their office hours.\n",
    "* In this room there are 10 grad students, and 10 undergrads.\n",
    "* 9 of the grad students are enjoying the class, and 5 of the undergrads are enjoying the class\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Based on just these 20 students, how can we make a good guess of the percentage of all students in this class who are enjoying it?</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "We might notice that although the amount of grads and undergrads in the room is equal, across the whole class there are a lot more undergrads than grad students. We might then want to **overweight** the opinions of the 10 undergrads relative to the 10 grad students.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in order to trust this estimate, we have made a pretty **huge assumption**! This assumes that the 10 grad students are representative of all 100 grad students, and the 10 undergrads are representative of all 1100 undergrads.\n",
    "\n",
    "(9 / 10) * (100 / 1200) + (5 / 10) * (1100 / 1200) = 53.3%\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "This is an example of **post-stratification**. After we took a non-representative sample (the students in professor OH) of the population we're interested in (all students in this class), we used knowledge about the population to **reweight** responses.\n",
