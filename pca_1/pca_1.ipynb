    "\n",
    "1. Each *datapoint* in our output is a *dot product* between a row in the data matrix and a column in the operations matrix. In this view, we perform multiple linear operations on the data <center><img src = \"images/matmul2.png\" width=\"550vw\"></center>\n",
    "2. Each *column* in our output is a *linear transformation* of the original columns based on a column in the transformation matrix <center><img src = \"images/matmul3.png\" width=\"550vw\"></center>\n",

    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix decomposition** (a.k.a **matrix factorization**) is the opposite of matrix multiplication. Instead of multiplying two matrices, we want to *decompose* a single matrix into 2 separate matrices. Just like with real numbers, there are infinite ways to decompose a matrix into a product of two matrices. For example, $9.9$ can be decomposed as $1.1 * 9$, $3.3 * 3$, $1 * 9.9$, etc. Additionally, the sizes of the 2 decomposed matrices can vary drastically. In the example below, the first factorization (top) multiplies a $3\\times2$ matrix by a $2\\times3$ matrix while the second factorization (bottom) multiplies a $3\\times3$ matrix by a $3\\times3$ matrix; both result in the original matrix on the right.\n",

    "<center><img src = \"images/matrix_decomp.png\" width=\"550vw\"></center>\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "We can even expand the $3\\times3$ matrices to $3\\times4$ and $4\\times3$ (shown below as the factorization on top), but this defeats the point of dimensionality reduction since we're adding more \"useless\" dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src = \"images/factorization_constraints_1.png\" width=\"550vw\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, we also can't reduce the dimension to $3\\times1$ and $1\\times3$ (shown below as the factorization on the bottom); since the rank of the original matrix is greater than 1, this decomposition will not result in the original matrix. \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we often work with datasets containing many features, so we usually want to **construct decompositions where the dimensionality is below the rank of the original matrix**. While this does not recover the data exactly, we can still provide **approximate reconstructions** of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will discuss a method to automatically and approximately factorize data. This avoids redundant features and makes computation easier because we can train on less data. Since some approximations are better than others, we will also discuss how the method helps us capture a lot of information in a low number of dimensions.\n",

    "In this section, we talk about **maximizing variance** captured from the original data. We want to retain **variance of the features ($\\mathbb{X}$)**. Variance in the features is **information**. For example, if the features have no variance, we cannot use them to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "In PCA, our goal is to transform observations from high-dimensional data down to **low dimensions** (often 2, as most visualizations are 2D) through linear transformations. In other words, we want to find a linear transformation that creates a low-dimension representation that captures as much of the original dataâ€™s **variability** as possible.\n",

We'll discuss more about these two terms in a bit.\n",

    "We often perform PCA during the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) stage of our data science lifecycle when we don't know what model to use. It helps us with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Visually identifying clusters** of similar observations in high dimensions.\n",
    "* Removing irrelevant dimensions if we suspect that the **dataset is inherently low rank**. For example, if the columns are collinear, there are many attributes, but only a few mostly determine the rest through linear associations.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Finding directions of **maximum variability** in the data.\n",
    "2. Finding the low dimensional (rank) matrix factorization that **best approximates the data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute the first approach of **variance maximization** framing (more common), we can find the variances of each attribute with `np.var` and then keep the $k$ attributes with the highest variance. For example, if we are working with data that has the features width, length, area, and perimeter, we can compute the total variance as the sum of the variance in each column. The total variance would be 402.56, and we want to find a representation which captures as much of the original dataâ€™s **total variance** as possible. Here, we choose area and perimeter which captures 389.52 of the original 402.56.\n",

    "However, this approach limits us to work with attributes individually; it cannot resolve collinearity, and we cannot combine features.

    "### PCA Procedure (Overview)\n",

    "To perform PCA on a matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Center the data matrix** by subtracting the mean of each attribute column.\n",
    "2. To find the $i$-th **principal component**, $v_i$:\n",

    "    2. $v$ gives a one-dimensional projection of the data.\n",

    "    4. Choose $v$ such that it is orthogonal to all previous principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $k$ principal components capture the **most variance** of any $k$-dimensional reduction of the data matrix. In the example below from [Stack Exchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2691/making-sense-of-principal-component-analysis-eigenvectors-eigenvalues/140579#140579), maximizing variance means **spreading out the red dots**, and minimizing error (the projections) means **making red lines short**.\n",
