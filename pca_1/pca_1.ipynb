    "- N observations (datapoints/rows)\n",
    "- d attributes (features/columns).\n",

    "In Linear Algebra, we think of data being a collection of vectors. Vectors have a *dimension*, meaning they have some number of unique elements. Row and column now denotes the direction a vector is written (horizontally, like a row, or vertically, like a column):\n",
