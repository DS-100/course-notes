    "So far, we've used visualizations like rugplots or scatterplots to help us identify clusters in our dataset. Since we humans are 3D beings, we can’t visualize beyond three dimensions, but many datasets come with more than three features. In order to visualize multidimensional data, we can reduce the dataset to lower dimensions through **dimensionality reduction**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we have been working with data tables with rows and columns. These rows and columns correspond to observations and attributes about said observations. Now, we have to be a bit more clear with our wording to follow the language of linear algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset of:\n",
    "- N observations (data points/rows)\n",
    "- d attributes (features/columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Linear Algebra, we think of data being a collection of vectors. Vectors have a *dimension*, meaning they have some number of unique elements. Row and column now denotes the direction a vector is written (horizontally, like a row, or vertically, like a column):\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Algebra views our data as a matrix:\n",
    "- N row vectors in a d-Dimensions, OR\n",

    "\n",
    "<center><img src = \"images/dataset_dims.png\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the dataset below has 4 columns, but the `Weight (lbs)` column is actually just a linear transformation of the `Weight (kg)` column. Thus, no new information is captured, and the matrix of our dataset has a (column) rank of 3! Despite having 4 columns, we still say that this data is 3-dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src = \"images/dataset4.png\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting the weight columns together reveals the key visual intuition. While the two columns visually span a 2D space as a line, the data does not deviate at all from that singular line. This means that one of the weight columns is redundant! Even given the option to cover the whole 2D space, the data below does not. It might as well not have this dimension, which is why we still do not consider the data below to span more than 1 dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src = \"images/dataset3.png\" width=\"400vw\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when there are outliers? Below, we've added one outlier point to the dataset above, and just that is enough to change the rank of the matrix from 1 to 2 dimensions. However, the data is still very much 1-dimensional. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src = \"images/dataset3_outlier.png\" width=\"400vw\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, dimensionality reduction is generally an *approximation* of the original data that's achieved by projecting the data onto a desired dimension. However, there are many ways to project a dataset onto a lower dimension. How do we choose the best one? \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src = \"images/diff_reductions.png\" width=\"1000vw\"></center>\n",

    "Suppose we know the child mortality rate of a given country. Linear regression tries to predict the fertility rate from the mortality rate; for example, if the mortality is 6, we might guess the fertility is near 4. The regression line tells us the “best” prediction of fertility given all possible mortality values by minimizing the root mean squared error [see vertical red lines, only some shown].\n",

    "The rank 1 approximation is close but not the same as the mortality regression line. Instead of minimizing *horizontal* or *vertical* error, our rank 1 approximation minimizes the error *perpendicular* to the subspace onto which we’re projecting. That is, SVD finds the line such that if we project our data onto that line, the error between the projection and our original data is minimized. The similarity of the rank 1 approximation and the fertility was just a coincidence. Looking at adiposity and bicep size from our body measurements dataset, we see the 1D subspace onto which we are projecting is between the two regression lines.\n",
