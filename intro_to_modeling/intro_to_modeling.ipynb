Specifically, the next sequence of lectures will explore predictive modeling: generating models to make some predictions about the world around us.

        "## What is a Model?\n",
        "\n",
        "A model is an **idealized representation** of a system. A system is a set of principles or procedures according to which something functions. We live in a world full of systems: the procedure of turning on a light happens according to a specific set of rules dictating the flow of electricity. The truth behind how any event occurs is usually complex, and many times the specifics are unknown. The workings of the world can be viewed as its own giant procedure. Models seek to simplify the world and distill them into workable pieces.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "We model the fall of an object on Earth as subject to a constant acceleration of $9.81 m/s^2$ due to gravity.\n",
        "\n",
        "- While this describes the behavior of our system, it is merely an approximation.\n",
        "- It doesn’t account for the effects of air resistance, local variations in gravity, etc.\n",
        "- In practice, it’s accurate enough to be useful!\n",

        "### Reasons for Building Models\n",
        "\n",
        "Why do we want to build models? As far as data scientists and statisticians are concerned, there are three reasons, and each implies a different focus on modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. To explain complex phenomena occurring in the world we live in. Examples of this might be:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - How are the parents' average height related to their children's average height?\n",
        "    - How does an object’s velocity and acceleration impact how far it travels? (Physics: $d = d_0 + vt + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$) \n",
        "    \n",
        "    In these cases, we care about creating models that are *simple and interpretable*, allowing us to understand what the relationships between our variables are.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. To make accurate predictions about unseen data. Some examples include:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Can we predict if an email is spam or not?\n",
        "    - Can we generate a one-sentence summary of this 10-page long article?\n",
        "\n",
        "    When making predictions, we care more about making extremely accurate predictions, at the cost of having an uninterpretable model. These are sometimes called black-box models and are common in fields like deep learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. To measure the causal effects of one event on some other event. For example,\n",
        "   \n",
        "    - Does smoking *cause* lung cancer?\n",
        "    - Does a job training program *cause* increases in employment and wages?\n",
        "\n",
        "    This is a much harder question because most statistical tools are designed to infer association, not causation. We will not focus on this task in Data 100, but you can take other advanced classes on causal inference (e.g., Stat 156, Data 102) if you are intrigued! \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Probabilistic models: Models that attempt to understand how random processes evolve. These are more general and can be used to describe many phenomena in the real world. These models commonly make simplifying assumptions about the nature of the world.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - [Poisson Process models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process): Used to model random events that happen with some probability at any point in time and are strictly increasing in count, such as the arrival of customers at a store. \n",
