The `left_on` and `right_on` parameters are assigned to the string names of the columns to be used when performing the join. These two `on` parameters tell `pandas` what values should act as pairing keys to determine which rows to merge across the DataFrames. We'll talk more about this idea of a pairing key next lecture."
