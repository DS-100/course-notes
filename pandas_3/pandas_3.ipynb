    "Now, we're ready to join the two tables. [`pd.merge`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html) is the `pandas` method used to join DataFrames together. The `left` and `right` parameters are used to specify the DataFrames to be joined. The `left_on` and `right_on` parameters are assigned to the string names of the columns to be used when performing the join. These two `on` parameters tell `pandas` what values should act as pairing keys to determine which rows to merge across the DataFrames. We'll talk more about this idea of a pairing key next lecture."
