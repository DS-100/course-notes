        "\n",
        "In fact, these (and other) aggregation functions are so common that `pandas` allows for writing shorthand. Instead of explicitly stating the use of `.agg`, we can call the function directly on the `GroupBy` object.\n",

        "- `elections.groupby(\"Candidate\").agg(mean)` \n",

For example, the code `elections[elections[\"%\"] < 45]` will check the `\"%\"` value of every single row in `elections`; if it is less than 45, then that row will be kept in the output. `groupby.filter`, in contrast, applies a boolean condition *across* all rows in a group.
