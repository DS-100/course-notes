For large datasets (with perhaps billions of datapoints), finding the gradient across all the data is incredibly computationally taxing; gradient descent will converge slowly because each individual update is slow.\n",

The sampling strategy is generally without replacement (data is shuffled and batch size examples are selected one at a time.)\n",

In contrast, stochastic gradient descent involve an element of randomness. Since only a subset of the full data is used to update the guess for $\\vec{\\theta}$ at each iteration, there's a chance the algorithm will not progress towards the true minimum of loss with each update. Over the longer term, these stochastic techniques should still converge towards the optimal solution. \n",
