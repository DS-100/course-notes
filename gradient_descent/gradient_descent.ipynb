Note that at least one solution always exists because intuitively, we can always draw a line of best fit for a given set of data, but there may be multiple lines that are “equally good”. (Formal proof is beyond this course.) Let's now revisit the interpretation for uniqueness of a solution at the end of the last lecture, but with the new notation of $p$ instead of $p+1$ features.\n",

    "* $\\hat{\\theta}$ has a **unique** solution $\\iff$ the square matrix $\\mathbb{X}^T\\mathbb{X}$ is **invertible** $\\iff$ $\\mathbb{X}^T\\mathbb{X}$ is full rank.\n",
    "  * The **column rank** of a square matrix is the max number of linearly independent columns it contains.\n",
    "  * An $n$ x $n$ square matrix is deemed full column rank when all of its columns are linearly independent. That is, its rank would be equal to $n$.\n",
    "  * $\\mathbb{X}^T\\mathbb{X}$ has shape $p \\times p$, and therefore has max rank $p$. \n",
    "* $rank(\\mathbb{X}^T\\mathbb{X})$ = $rank(\\mathbb{X})$ (proof out of scope).\n",
    "* Therefore, $\\mathbb{X}^T\\mathbb{X}$ has rank $p$ $\\iff$  $\\mathbb{X}$ has rank $p$ $\\iff \\mathbb{X}$ is full column rank.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if $\\mathbb{X}$ is not full column rank, we will not have unique estimates. This can happen for two major reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If our design matrix $\\mathbb{X}$ is \"**wide**\":\n",
    "    * If n < p, then we have way more features (columns) than observations (rows).\n",
    "    * Then $rank(\\mathbb{X})$ = min(n, p) < p, so $\\hat{\\theta}$ is not unique.\n",
    "    * Typically we have n >> p so this is less of an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If our design matrix $\\mathbb{X}$ has features that are **linear combinations** of other features:\n",
    "    * By definition, rank of $\\mathbb{X}$ is number of linearly independent columns in $\\mathbb{X}$.\n",
    "    * Example: If “Width”, “Height”, and “Perimeter” are all columns,\n",
    "      * Perimeter = 2 * Width + 2 * Height  $\\rightarrow$  $\\mathbb{X}$ is not full rank.\n",
