While this update rule works well in theory, it is not practical in most circumstances. For large datasets (with perhaps billions of datapoints), finding the gradient across all the data is incredibly computationally taxing; gradient descent will converge slowly because each individual update is slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stochastic (mini-batch) gradient descent** tries to address this issue. In stochastic descent, only a *sample* of the full dataset is used at each update. We estimate the true gradient of the loss surface using just that sample of data. The **batch size** is the number of data points used in each sample. The sampling strategy is generally without replacement (data is shuffled and batch size examples are selected one at a time.)\n",

In contrast, stochastic gradient descent involve an element of randomness. Since only a subset of the full data is used to update the guess for $\\vec{\\theta}$ at each iteration, there's a chance the algorithm will not progress towards the true minimum of loss with each update. Over the longer term, these stochastic techniques should still converge towards the optimal solution. \n",

    "The diagrams below represent a \"bird's eye view\" of a loss surface from above. Notice that batch gradient descent takes a direct path towards the optimal $\\hat{\\theta}$.
