    "Now that we have this deep understanding of the modeling process, let's expand our knowledge of possible modeling tasks. \n",

    "## Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next two lectures, we'll tackle the task of **classification**. A classification problem aims to classify data into  *categories*. Unlike in regression, where we predicted a numeric output, classification involves predicting some **categorical variable**, or **response**, $y$. Examples of classification tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predicting which team won from its turnover percentage \n",
    "* Predicting the day of the week of a meal from the total restaurant bill \n",
    "* Predicting the model of car from its horsepower\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of different types of classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Binary classification**: classify data into two classes, and responses $y$ are either 0 or 1\n",
    "* **Multiclass classification**: classify data into multiple classes (e.g., image labeling, next word in a sentence, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further combine multiple related classfication predictions (e.g., translation, voice recognition, etc.) to tackle complex problems through structured prediction tasks.\n",

    "### Modeling Process\n",
    "To build a classification model, we need to modify our modeling workflow slightly. Recall that in regression we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Created a design matrix of numeric features\n",
    "2. Defined our model as a linear combination of these numeric features\n",
    "3. Used the model to output numeric predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification, however, we no longer want to output numeric predictions; instead, we want to predict the class to which a datapoint belongs. This means that we need to update our workflow. To build a classification model, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a design matrix of numeric features.\n",
    "2. Define our model as a linear combination of these numeric features, transformed by a non-linear **sigmoid function**. This outputs a numeric quantity.\n",
    "3. Apply a **decision rule** to interpret the outputted quantity and decide a classification.\n",
    "4. Output a predicted class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two key differences: as we'll soon see, we need to incorporate a non-linear transformation to capture the non-linear relationships hidden in our data. We do so by applying the sigmoid function to a linear combination of the features. Secondly, we must apply a decision rule to convert the numeric quantities computed by our model into an actual class prediction. This can be as simple as saying that any datapoint with a feature greater than some number $x$ belongs to Class 1.\n",
