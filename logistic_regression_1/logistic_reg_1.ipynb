    "Up until this point in the class , we've focused on **regression** tasks - that is, predicting an *unbounded numerical quantity* from a given dataset. We discussed optimization, feature engineering, and regularization all in the context of performing regression to predict some quantity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have this deep understanding of the modeling process, let's expand our knowledge of possible modeling tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next two lectures, we'll tackle the task of **classification**. A classification problem aims to classify data into  *categories*. Unlike in regression, where we predicted a numeric output, classification involves predicting some **categorical variable**, or **response**, $y$. Examples of classification tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predicting which team won from its turnover percentage \n",
    "* Predicting the day of the week of a meal from the total restaurant bill \n",
    "* Predicting the model of car from its horsepower\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of different types of classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Binary classification**: classify data into two classes, and responses $y$ are either 0 or 1\n",
    "* **Multiclass classification**: classify data into multiple classes (e.g., image labeling, next word in a sentence, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further combine multiple related classfication predictions (e.g., translation, voice recognition, etc.) to tackle complex problems through structured prediction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Data 100, we will mostly deal with **binary classification**, where we are attempting to classify data into one of two classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling Process\n",
    "To build a classification model, we need to modify our modeling workflow slightly. Recall that in regression we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Created a design matrix of numeric features\n",
    "2. Defined our model as a linear combination of these numeric features\n",
    "3. Used the model to output numeric predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification, however, we no longer want to output numeric predictions; instead, we want to predict the class to which a datapoint belongs. This means that we need to update our workflow. To build a classification model, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a design matrix of numeric features.\n",
    "2. Define our model as a linear combination of these numeric features, transformed by a non-linear **sigmoid function**. This outputs a numeric quantity.\n",
    "3. Apply a **decision rule** to interpret the outputted quantity and decide a classification.\n",
    "4. Output a predicted class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two key differences: as we'll soon see, we need to incorporate a non-linear transformation to capture the non-linear relationships hidden in our data. We do so by applying the sigmoid function to a linear combination of the features. Secondly, we must apply a decision rule to convert the numeric quantities computed by our model into an actual class prediction. This can be as simple as saying that any datapoint with a feature greater than some number $x$ belongs to Class 1.\n",
