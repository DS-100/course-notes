We do so by applying the sigmoid function to a linear combination of the features. Secondly, we must apply a decision rule to convert the numeric quantities computed by our model into an actual class prediction. This can be as simple as saying that any datapoint with a feature greater than some number $x$ belongs to Class 1.\n",
