    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to predict the probability that a tumor is malignant, given it's mean radius and mean smoothness. Assume that we fit a logistic regression model (with no intercept), and somehow estimate the optimal parameters: $\\hat \\theta = [0.1, -0.5]$.\n",

    "In our derivation of logistic regression, we showed that $\\frac{p}{1-p} = e^{x^T\\theta}$. Equivalently, \n",

    "\n",
    "Having derived the logistic regression model, the next step is to estimate the optimal parameters $\\hat\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pitfalls of Squared Error Loss\n",

    "#### 1. Non-convex \n",

    "The MSE loss surface for logistic regression is non-convex. In the following example, you can see the function rises above the secant line, a clear violation of convexity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Depending on the initialization points, gradient descent may find multiple non-optimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Bounded\n",
    "\n",
    "A good loss function should penalize incorrect predictions; the MSE doesn't do this. Consider the following scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The predicted probability that some tumor is malignant is $0.99$ ($\\hat y = 0.99$). However, this tumor is truly benign ($y = 0$). The loss incurred by this misprediction is only $(0 - 0.99)^2 = 0.98$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, loss is always bounded $< 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Conceptually Questionable\n",
    "\n",
    "The MSE loss function itself is conceptually questionable. \n",
    "\n",

    "- $\\hat y$ is a probability\n",

    "Here, $x$ is `mean radius` and $y$ is `malignant`. By the definition of an average, the prediction for a given $x$ is thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\text{Sum of Nearby ``Malignant\" Values}}{\\text{Number of Points in Bin}}$$\n",

    "You'll notice that this is the proportion of malignant tumors in some point $x$'s bin. In a similar light, we can think of this proportion as the probability that point $x$ belongs to the malignant class (derived from it's nearest neighbors). That is, $P(Y = 1|x)$. This notation reads \"given a tumor with a mean radius of $x$, it belongs to class 1 (equivalently, the malignant class) with some specified probability\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recognize some similarities between $P(Y = 1|x)$ and $\\hat \\theta$ from our earlier coin toss example. $P(Y = 1|x)$ is a proportion of malignant tumors in a bin, whereas $\\hat \\theta$ was a proportion of heads in 10 coin tosses.
