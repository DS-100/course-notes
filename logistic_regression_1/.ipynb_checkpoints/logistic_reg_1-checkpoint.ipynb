This notation reads \"given a tumor with a mean radius of $x$, it belongs to class 1 (equivalently, the malignant class) with some specified probability\".\n",

    "### Pitfalls of Squared Error Loss\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2. Bounded\n",
    "\n",
    "A good loss function should penalize incorrect predictions; the MSE doesn't do this. Consider the following scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The predicted probability that some tumor is malignant is $0.99$ ($\\hat y = 0.99$). However, this tumor is truly benign ($y = 0$). The loss incurred by this misprediction is only $(0 - 0.99)^2 = 0.98$. \n",
