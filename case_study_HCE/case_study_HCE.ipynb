This is because tax burden in this area is determined by the estimated **value** of a house, which is different from its price. Since values change over time and there is no obvious indicators of value, they created a **model** to estimate the values of houses.

One of those moving parts was the **appeals system**. Homeowners are mailed the value their home is assess for by CCAO, and the homeowner can choose to appeal to a board of elected officials to try and change the listed value of their home, and thus how much they are taxed. In theory, this sounds like a very fair system: there is a human that oversees the final pricing of houses rather than just an algorithm. However, it ended up exacerbating the problems.   \n",
