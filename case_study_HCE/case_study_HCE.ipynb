    "- Redlining: making it difficult or impossible to get a federally-backed mortgage to buy a house in specific neighborhoods coded as “risky” (red). \n",

    "\n",

    "## The Response\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Cook County Open Data Initiative\n",
    "\n",
    "CCAO’s mandate under new Assessor, Fritz Kaegi\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distributional equity in property taxation = properties of same value treated alike during assessments\n",
    "- Creates new Office of Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"images/vis_9.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Incorporating Knowledge into the Data Science Life Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question/Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do we want to know?\n",
    "- What problems are we trying to solve?\n",
    "- What are the hypotheses we want to test?\n",
    "- What are our metrics for success?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different goals that we as data scientists have in mind when working with data. The goal that we have been focusing on primarily throughout this course until now has been accuracy. In the context of the Housing dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accurately, uniformly, and impartially assess the value of a home.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Following international standards (coefficient of dispersion)\n",
    "    - Predicting value of all homes with as little total error as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will now introduce a slightly different goal which centers around two new concepts: fairness and transparency. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a system that assesses house values that is fair to all people, across perceived racial and income differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Disrupts the circuit of corruption (Board of Review appeals process)\n",
    "    - Eliminates regressivity\n",
    "    - Engenders trust in the system among all stakeholders \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-definitions collapse=\"true\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definitions**: Fairness and Transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairness: The ability of our pipeline to accurately assess property values, accounting for disparities in geography, information, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Transparency: The ability of the data science department to share and explain pipeline results and decisions to both internal and external stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "These two goals are not mutually exclusive. Models can be fair and transparent in addition to being accurate. However, it is critical to acknowledge the existence of such goals in order to meet them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, when critiquing other data scientists' analyses, we must keep in mind **who is responsible for framing the problem**. For example, a data scientist who is a homeowner with a very expensive house may want to under-predict large values. **Who are the stakeholders** is another key detail to know when critiquing a study. Are the entities sponsoring the analyses interested in a certain outcome?\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, when you are conducting analysis, **your own experience can aid in understanding the problem**. For example, a data scientist who lived in Cook County can provide personal experience about the consequences of inequitable pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Acquisition and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "- What data do we have and what data do we need?\n",
    "- How will we sample more data?\n",
    "- Is our data representative of the population we want to study?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Sales data\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"images/vis_10.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than taking the data at face value, we can investigate the data further. How was this data collected? When? By whom? For what purposes? How and why were particular categories created? There are several important questions to ask when receiving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, attributes differentially reported. This may or many not be directly apparent just from looking at the data. For example, a column that is normally collected correctly in one geographic region may be less accurate for other regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, data that is missing can be almost as important as data that is present. Sometimes, data can be missing from certain populations more often than others. By not equally representing groups, false conclusions can be made about the underrepresented groups. For example, if we are interested in students' favorite sport and only ask basketball players, then we will come to a false conclusion about all students who do not favor basketball. \n",
    "\n",
    "We may also ask about other data sources. If we are working with potentially biased data, looking for data collected by other reputable sources might be valuable for addressing questions of bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- How is our data organized and what does it contain?\n",
    "- Do we already have relevant data?\n",
    "- What are the biases, anomalies, or other issues with the data?\n",
    "- How do we transform the data to enable effective analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for our claims to hold weight, we must show evidence. Some example questions and directions for investigation are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which attributes are most predictive of sales price?\n",
    "    - Measure correlations between important variables.\n",
    "2. Is the data uniformly distributed? \n",
    "    - Plot proportions of data coming from each neighborhood.\n",
    "3. Do all neighborhoods have up to date data? Do all neighborhoods have the same granularity?  \n",
    "    - Plot histogram of date values for each neighborhood against each other. \n",
    "4. Do some neighborhoods have missing or outdated data? \n",
    "    - Count proportions of missing values in each neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "CCAO noticed that low income neighborhoods had disproportionately spottier data. This informed them that they needed to develop new data collection practices--including finding new sources of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prediction and Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "- What does the data say about the world?\n",
    "- Does it answer our questions or accurately solve the problem?\n",
    "- How robust are our conclusions and can we trust the predictions? \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than using a singular model to predict sale prices (“fair market value”) of unsold properties, the CCAO fit machine learning models that discover patterns using known sale prices and characteristics of **similar and nearby properties**. It uses a different model for each township.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to traditional mass appraisal, the CCAO’s approach is more granular and more sensitive to neighborhood variations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reports Decisions, and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "- How successful is the system for each goal?\n",
    "    - accuracy/uniformity of the model.\n",
    "    - fairness and transparency that eliminates regressivity and engenders trust.\n",
    "- How do you know? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accuracy is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of a fair system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fairness and transparency are context-dependent and sociotechnical concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Learn to work with contexts, and consider how your data analysis will reshape them\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Keep in mind the power, and limits, of data analysis\n",
