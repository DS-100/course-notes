    "- Segregation and credit-market racism\n",
    "- Redlining: making it difficult or impossible to get a federally-backed mortgage to buy a house in specific neighborhoods coded as “risky” (red). \n",

    "### Incorporating Knowledge into the Data Science Life Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question/Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do we want to know?\n",
    "- What problems are we trying to solve?\n",
    "- What are the hypotheses we want to test?\n",
    "- What are our metrics for success?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different goals that we as data scientists have in mind when working with data. The goal that we have been focusing on primarily throughout this course until now has been accuracy. In the context of the Housing dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accurately, uniformly, and impartially assess the value of a home.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Following international standards (coefficient of dispersion)\n",
    "    - Predicting value of all homes with as little total error as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will pivot to a slightly different goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a system that assesses house values that is fair to all people, across perceived racial and income differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - disrupts the circuit of corruption (Board of Review appeals process)\n",
    "    - Eliminates regressivity\n",
    "    - Engenders trust in the system among all stakeholders \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-definitions collapse=\"true\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definitions**: Fairness and Transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairness: The ability of our pipeline to accurately assess property values, accounting for disparities in geography, information, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Transparency: The ability of the data science department to share and explain pipeline results and decisions to both internal and external stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Acquisition and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "- What data do we have and what data do we need?\n",
    "- How will we sample more data?\n",
    "- Is our data representative of the population we want to study?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Sales data\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"images/vis_10.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than taking the data at face value, we can investigate the data further. How was this data collected? When? By whom? For what purposes? How and why were particular categories created?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can incorporate our domain expertise during this stage by asking questions specific to the values of the features themselves. For the above dataset, a data scientist who is knowledgeable about racial inequities in housing appraisals can ask:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Are these attributes differentially reported? If so, how can this arise? \n",
    "- How are “improvements” (i.e. renovations) tracked and updated?\n",
    "- Which data is missing, and for which neighborhoods or populations is it missing? \n",
    "- What other data sources might be valuable for addressing the above questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- How is our data organized and what does it contain?\n",
    "- Do we already have relevant data?\n",
    "- What are the biases, anomalies, or other issues with the data?\n",
    "- How do we transform the data to enable effective analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for our claims to hold weight, we must show evidence. Some example questions and directions for investigation are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which attributes are most predictive of sales price?\n",
    "    - Measure correlations \n",
    "2. Is the data uniformly distributed? \n",
    "    - Plot proportions of data coming from each neighborhood.\n",
    "3. Do all neighborhoods have up to date data? Do all neighborhoods have the same granularity?  \n",
    "    - Plot histogram of date values for each neighborhood against each other. \n",
    "4. Do some neighborhoods have missing or outdated data? \n",
    "    - Count proportions of missing values in each neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "CCAO noticed that low income neighborhoods had disproportionately spottier data. This informed them that they needed to develop new data collection practices--including finding new sources of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prediction and Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "- What does the data say about the world?\n",
    "- Does it answer our questions or accurately solve the problem?\n",
    "- How robust are our conclusions and can we trust the predictions? \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than using a singular model to predict sale prices (“fair market value”) of unsold properties, the CCAO fit machine learning models that discover patterns using known sale prices and characteristics of **similar and nearby properties**. It uses a different model for each township.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to traditional mass appraisal, the CCAO’s approach is more granular and more sensitive to neighborhood variations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reports Decisions, and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "- How successful is the system for each goal?\n",
    "    - accuracy/uniformity of the model.\n",
    "    - fairness and transparency that eliminates regressivity and engenders trust.\n",
    "- How do you know? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accuracy is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of a fair system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fairness and transparency are context-dependent and sociotechnical concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Learn to work with contexts, and consider how your data analysis will reshape them\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Keep in mind the power, and limits, of data analysis\n",
