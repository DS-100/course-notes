<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="singular-value-decomposition-svd">Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)</h2>
<p>Singular value decomposition (SVD) is an important concept in linear algebra. Since this class requires a linear algebra course (MATH 54, 56 or EECS 16A) as a pre/co-requisite, we assume you have taken or are taking a linear algebra course, so we won’t explain SVD in its entirety. In particular, we will go over:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why SVD is a valid decomposition of rectangular matrices</li>
<li>Why PCA is an application of SVD.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not go much into the theory and details of SVD. Instead, we will only cover what is needed for a data science interpretation. If you’d like more information, check out <a href="https://eecs16b.org/notes/sp23/note14.pdf">EECS 16B Note 14</a> or <a href="https://eecs16b.org/notes/sp23/note15.pdf">EECS 16B Note 15</a>.</p>

<p>Orthonormal is a combination of two words: orthogonal and normal.</p>
<p>When we say the columns of a matrix are orthonormal, we say that</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The columns are all orthogonal to each other (all pairs of columns have a dot product of zero)</li>
<li>All columns are unit vectors (the length of each column vector is 1)
<center>
<img src="images/orthonormal.png" width="400vw">
</center></li>
</ol>
<p>Orthonormal matrices have a few important properties</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Orthonormal inverse</strong>: If an <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> has orthonormal columns, <span class="math inline">\(QQ^T= Iₘ\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q^TQ=Iₙ\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Rotation of coordinates</strong>: the linear transformation represented by an orthonormal matrix is often a rotation (and less often a reflection). We can imagine columns of the matrix as where the unit vectors of the original space will land. :::</li>

<center><img src = "images/svd.png" width="500vw"></center>
<br>
We’ve seen that $U$ and $V$ represent rotations, and $S$ represents scaling. Therefore, SVD says that any matrix can be decomposed into a rotation, then a scaling, and another rotation.

<p>In <code>NumPy</code>, the SVD decomposition function can be called with <code>np.linalg.svd</code> (<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.svd.html">documentation</a>).

<p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be easily mixed up, especially when you have to keep track of so many acronyms. Here is a quick summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>SVD: a linear algebra algorithm that splits a matrix into 3 component parts.</li>
<li>PCA: a data science procedure used for dimensionality reduction that <em>uses</em> SVD as one of the steps.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deriving-principal-components-from-svd">Deriving Principal Components From SVD</h3>
<p>After centering <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> so that each column has a mean of 0, we find it’s SVD: <span class="math display">\[ X = U S V^T \]</span></p>
<p>Because X is centered, the covariance matrix of X, <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, is equal to <span class="math inline">\(X^T X\)</span>. Rearranging this equation, we get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\Sigma &amp;= X^T X \\
&amp;= (U S V^T)^T U S V^T \\
&amp;= V S^T U^T U S V^T &amp; \text{U is orthonormal, so $U^T U = I$} \\
&amp;= V S^2 V^T
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Multiplying both sides by V, we get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\Sigma V &amp;= VS^2 V^T V \\
&amp;= V S^2
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This shows that The columns of V are the <strong>eigenvectors</strong> of the covariance matrix Σ and therefore the <strong>principal components</strong>. Additionally, the squared singular values <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span> are the <strong>eigenvalues</strong> of Σ.</p>
<!-- <center><img src="images/slide15.png" alt='slide15' width='500'></center> -->
<p>We’ve now shown that the first <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> columns of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> (equivalently, the first <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> rows of <span class="math inline">\(V^{T}\)</span>) are the first k principal components of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. We can use them to construct the <strong>latent vector representation</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, by projecting <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> onto the principal components.</p>
<!-- TODO if we have time: add lin alg review for projection  -->
<center>
<img src="images/Z.png" alt="slide16" width="500">
</center>
<p>From this equation <span class="math inline">\(Z = X V\)</span>, we can compoute a second way to calculate <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
Z &amp;= X V \\
&amp;= USV^T V \\
&amp;= U S
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z = XV = US\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, we can construct <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s’ latent vector representation <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> through:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>projecting <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> onto the first <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> columns of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V[:, :k]\)</span></li>
<li>multiplying the first <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> columns of U and the first <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> rows of S</li>
</ol>
<p>Using <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, we can approximately recover the original <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> matrix by multiplying <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(V^T\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[ Z V^T = XV V^T = USV^T = X\]</span></p>

<p>The elements of each column of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> (row of <span class="math inline">\(V^{T}\)</span>) rotate the original feature vectors into a principal component.</p>
<p>The first column of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> indicates how each feature contributes (e.g.&nbsp;positive, negative, etc.) to principal component 1.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/rotate_center_plot.png" alt="slide17" width="750">
</center>
<p>Coupled together, this interpretation also allows us to understand that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The principal components are all <strong>orthogonal</strong> to each other because the columns of U are orthonormal.</li>
<li>Principal components are <strong>axis-aligned</strong>. That is, if you plot two PCs on a 2D plane, one will lie on the x-axis, the other on the y-axis.</li>
<li>Principal components are <strong>linear combinations</strong> of columns in our data X</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-variance-and-centering">Data Variance and Centering</h2>
<p>We define the total variance of a data matrix as the sum of variances of attributes. The principal components are a low-dimension representation that capture as much of the original data’s total variance as possible. Formally, the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th singular value tells us the <strong>component score</strong>, i.e., how much of the data variance is captured by the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th principal component. Supposing the number of datapoints is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{i-th component score} = \frac{(\text{i-th singular value}^2)}{n}\]</span></p>
<p>Summing up the component scores is equivalent to computing the total variance <em>if we center our data</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Data Centering</strong>: PCA has a data centering step that precedes any singular value decomposition, where if implemented defines the component score as above.</p>
<p>If you want to dive deeper into PCA, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNSVjnsviglFoY2nXildDCcv">Steve Brunton’s SVD Video Series</a> is a great resource.</p>

<section id="pca-plot" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pca-plot">PCA Plot</h3>
<p>We often plot the first two principal components using a scatter plot, with PC1 on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis and PC2 on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis. This is often called a PCA plot.</p>
<p>If the first two singular values are large and all others are small, then two dimensions are enough to describe most of what distinguishes one observation from another. If not, then a PCA plot is omitting lots of information.</p>
<p>PCA plots help us assess similarities between our data points and if there are any clusters in our dataset. In the case study before, for example, we could create the following PCA plot:</p>

<section id="scree-plots" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scree-plots">Scree Plots</h3>
<p>A scree plot shows the <strong>variance ratio</strong> captured by each principal component, with the largest variance ratio first. They help us visually determine the number of dimensions needed to describe the data reasonably. The singular values that fall in the region of the plot after a large drop-off correspond to principal components that are <strong>not</strong> needed to describe the data since they explain a relatively low proportion of the total variance of the data. This point where adding more principal components results in diminishing returns is called the “elbow” and is the point just before the line flattens out. Using this “elbow method”, we can see that the elbow is at the second principal component.</p>

<section id="biplots" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="biplots">Biplots</h3>
<p>Biplots superimpose the directions onto the plot of PC2 vs PC1, where vector <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> corresponds to the direction for feature <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> (e.g.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(v_{1j}, v_{2j}\)</span>). There are several ways to scale biplot vectors – in this course, we plot the direction itself. For other scalings, which can lead to more interpretable directions/loadings, see <a href="https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2019/11/06/what-are-biplots.html">SAS biplots</a></p>
<p>Through biplots, we can interpret how features correlate with the principal components shown: positively, negatively, or not much at all.</p>

<p>The directions of the arrow are (<span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span>) where <span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span> are how that specific feature column contributes to PC1 and PC2, respectively. <span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span> are elements of the first and second columns of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, respectively (i.e., the first two rows of <span class="math inline">\(V^T\)</span>).</p>
<p>Say we were considering feature 3, and say that was the purple arrow labeled “520” here (pointing bottom right).</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span> are the third elements of the respective columns in <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. They are scale feature 3’s column vector in the linear transformation to PC1 and PC2, respectively.</li>
<li>Here we would infer that <span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> (in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>/PC1-direction) is positive, meaning that a linear increase in feature 3 would correspond to a linear increase of PC1, meaning feature 3 and PC1 are positively correlated.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span> (in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>/pc2-direction) is negative, meaning a linear increase in feature 3 would result correspond to a linear decrease in PC2, meaning feature 3 and PC2 are negatively correlated.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-house-of-representatives-voting">Example: House of Representatives Voting</h2>
<p>Let’s examine how the House of Representatives (of the 116th Congress, 1st session) voted in the month of September 2019.</p>
<p>Specifically, we’ll look at the records of Roll call votes. From the U.S. Senate (<a href="https://www.senate.gov/reference/Index/Votes.htm">link</a>): Roll call votes occur when a representative or senator votes “yea” or “nay” so that the names of members voting on each side are recorded. A voice vote is a vote in which those in favor or against a measure say “yea” or “nay,” respectively, without the names or tallies of members voting on each side being recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Do legislators’ roll call votes show a relationship with their political party?</strong></p>

<p>If the first two singular values are large and all others are small, then two dimensions are enough to describe most of what distinguishes one observation from another. If not, then a PCA scatter plot is omitting lots of information.</p>
<p>An equivalent way to evaluate this is to determine the <strong>variance ratios</strong>, i.e., the fraction of the variance each PC contributes to total variance.</p>

<p>As shown in the demo, the primary goal of PCA is to transform observations from high-dimensional data down to low dimensions through linear transformations.</p>
<p>A related goal of PCA connects back to the idea that a low-dimension representation of the data should capture the variability of the original data. For example, if the first two singular values are large and the others are relatively small, then two dimensions are probably enough to describe most of what distinguishes one observation from another. However, if this is not the case, then a PCA scatter plot is probably omitting lots of information.</p>
<p>We can use the following formulas to quantify the amount each principal component contributes to the total variance:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{component score} = \frac{s_i^{2}}{N}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{total variance} = \text{sum of all the component scores} = \sum\_{i=1}^k \frac{s_i^{2}}{N} \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{variance ratio of principal component i} = \frac{\text{component score i}}{\text{total variance}} = \frac{s*i^{2} / N}{\sum*{i=1}^k s_i^{2} / N}\]</span></p>
<p>In Python, assuming you had a 1D <code>NumPy</code> array of singular values <code>s</code> returned by <code>np.linalg.svd</code>, you could compute the list of variances ratios with <code>s**2 / sum(s**2)</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Visually identifying clusters of similar observations in high dimensions.</li>
<li>Removing irrelevant dimensions if we suspect that the dataset is inherently low rank. For example, if the columns are collinear: there are many attributes but only a few mostly determine the rest through linear associations.</li>
<li>Finding a small basis for representing variations in complex things, e.g., images, genes.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="regression-minimizing-horizontalverticle-error">Regression: Minimizing Horizontal/Verticle Error</h3>
<p>Suppose we know the child mortality rate of a given country. Linear regression tries to predict the fertility rate from the mortality rate; for example, if the mortality is 6, we might guess the fertility is near 4. The regression line tells us the “best” prediction of fertility given all possible mortality values by minimizing the root mean squared error [see vertical red lines, only some shown].</p>
<center>
<img src="images/lin_reg.png" width="400vw">
</center>
<p><br> We can also perform a regression in the reverse direction, that is, given the fertility, we try to predict the mortality. In this case, we get a different regression line which minimizes the root mean squared length of the horizontal lines.</p>

<p>The rank 1 approximation is close but not the same as the mortality regression line. Instead of minimizing <em>horizontal</em> or <em>vertical</em> error, our rank 1 approximation minimizes the error <em>perpendicular</em> to the subspace onto which we’re projecting. That is, SVD finds the line such that if we project our data onto that line, the error between the projection and our original data is minimized. The similarity of the rank 1 approximation and the fertility was just a coincidence. Looking at adiposity and bicep size from our body measurements dataset, we see the 1D subspace onto which we are projecting is between the two regression lines.</p>

<p>In higher dimensions, the idea behind principal components is just the same! Suppose we have 30-dimensional data and decide to use the first 5 principal components. Our procedure minimizes the error between the original 30-dimensional data and the projection of that 30-dimensional data on to the “best” 5-dimensional subspace.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bonus-automatic-factorization">(Bonus) Automatic Factorization</h2>
<p>One key fact to remember is that the decomposition are not arbitrary. The <em>rank</em> of a matrix limits how small our inner dimensions can be if we want to perfectly recreate our matrix. The proof for this is out of scope.</p>
<p>Even if we know we have to factorize our matrix using an inner dimension of R, that still leaves a large space of solutions to traverse. What if we have a procedure to automatically factorize a rank R matrix into an R dimensional representation with some transformation matrix?</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower dimensional representation avoids redundant features.</li>
<li>Imagine a 1000-dimensional dataset: If the rank is only 5, it’s much easier to do EDA after this mystery procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>What if we wanted a 2D representation? It’s valuable to compress all of the data that is relevant onto as few dimensions as possible in order to plot it efficiently. Some 2D matrices yield better approximations than others. How well can we do?</p>

<p><em>Setup</em>: Consider the design matrix <span class="math inline">\(X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\)</span>, where the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>-th column (corresponding to the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>-th feature) is <span class="math inline">\(x_j \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and the element in row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, column <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(x_{ij}\)</span>. Further, define <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}\)</span> as the <strong>centered</strong> design matrix. The <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>-th column is <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{x}_j \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and the element in row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, column <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{x}_{ij} = x_{ij} - \bar{x_j}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x_j}\)</span> is the mean of the <span class="math inline">\(x_j\)</span> column vector from the original <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Variance</em>: Construct the <strong>covariance matrix</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n} \tilde{X}^T \tilde{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>-th element along the diagonal is the <strong>variance</strong> of the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>-th column of the original design matrix <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left( \frac{1}{n} \tilde{X}^T \tilde{X} \right)_{jj} = \frac{1}{n} \tilde{x}_j ^T \tilde{x}_j = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^n (\tilde{x}_{ij} )^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^n (x_{ij} - \bar{x_j})^2\]</span></p>
<p><em>SVD</em>: Suppose singular value decomposition of the <em>centered</em> design matrix <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}\)</span> yields <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X} = U S V^T\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(U \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\)</span> are matrices with orthonormal columns, and <span class="math inline">\(S \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\)</span> is a diagonal matrix with singular values of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{X}^T \tilde{X} &amp;= (U S V^T )^T (U S V^T) \\
&amp;= V S U^T U S V^T  &amp; (S^T = S) \\
&amp;= V S^2 V^T &amp; (U^T U = I) \\
\frac{1}{n} \tilde{X}^T \tilde{X} &amp;= \frac{1}{n} V S V^T =V \left( \frac{1}{n} S \right) V^T \\
\frac{1}{n} \tilde{X}^T \tilde{X} V &amp;= V \left( \frac{1}{n} S \right) V^T V = V \left( \frac{1}{n} S \right) &amp; \text{(right multiply by }V \rightarrow V^T V = I \text{)} \\
V^T \frac{1}{n} \tilde{X}^T \tilde{X} V &amp;= V^T V \left( \frac{1}{n} S \right) = \frac{1}{n} S &amp; \text{(left multiply by }V^T \rightarrow V^T V = I \text{)} \\
\left( \frac{1}{n} \tilde{X}^T \tilde{X} \right)_{jj} &amp;= \frac{1}{n}S_j^2  &amp; \text{(Define }S_j\text{ as the} j\text{-th singular value)} \\
\frac{1}{n} S_j^2 &amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^n (x_{ij} - \bar{x_j})^2
