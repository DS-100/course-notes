    "### Sample Statistics\n",
    "Today, we've talked extensively about populations; if we know the distribution of a random variable, we can reliably compute expectation, variance, functions of the random variable, etc. \n",
    "Note that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The distribution of a *population* describes how a random variable behaves across *all* individuals of interest. \n",
    "* The distribution of a *sample* describes how a random variable behaves in a *specific sample* from the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Data Science, however, we often do not have access to the whole population, so we don‚Äôt know its distribution. As such, we need to collect a sample and use its distribution to estimate or infer properties of the population. In cases like these, we can take several samples of size $n$ from the population (an easy way to do this is using `df.sample(n, replace=True)`), and compute the mean of each *sample*. When sampling, we make the (big) assumption that we sample uniformly at random *with replacement* from the population; each observation in our sample is a random variable drawn i.i.d from our population distribution. Remember that our sample mean is a random variable since it depends on our randomly drawn sample! On the other hand, our population mean is simply a number (a fixed value).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Mean Properties\n",
    "Consider an i.i.d. sample $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ drawn from a population with mean ùúá and SD ùúé.\n",
    "We define the **sample mean** as $$\\bar{X}_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation of the sample mean is given by: \n",
    "$$\\begin{align} \n",
    "    \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}_n] &= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E}[X_i] \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\frac{1}{n} (n \\mu) \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\mu \n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance is given by: \n",
    "$$\\begin{align} \n",
    "    \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_n) &= \\frac{1}{n^2} \\text{Var}( \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i) \\\\\n",
    "    &=  \\frac{1}{n^2} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n \\text{Var}(X_i) \\right) \\\\\n",
    "    &=  \\frac{1}{n^2} (n \\sigma^2) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\n",

    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is:\n",
    "$$ \\text{SD}(\\bar{X}_n) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\n",
    " \n",
    "$\\bar{X}_n$ is **normally distributed** (in the limit) by the **Central Limit Theorem** (CLT).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "In [Data 8](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/4/Central_Limit_Theorem.html?) and in the previous lecture, you encountered the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**. \n",
    "This is a powerful theorem for estimating the distribution of a population with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ from a collection of smaller samples. The CLT tells us that if an i.i.d sample of size $n$ is large, then the probability distribution of the **sample mean** is **roughly normal** with mean $\\mu$ and SD of $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$. More generally, any theorem that provides the rough distribution of a statistic and **doesn't need the distribution of the population** is valuable to data scientists! This is because we rarely know a lot about the population. \n",

    "<img src=\"images/clt.png\" alt='clt' width='400'>\n",
    "\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the CLT assumes that each observation in our samples is drawn i.i.d from the distribution of the population. In addition, the CLT is accurate only when $n$ is \"large\", but what counts as a \"large\" sample size depends on the specific distribution. If a population is highly symmetric and unimodal, we could need as few as $n=20$; if a population is very skewed, we need a larger $n$. If in doubt, you can bootstrap the sample mean and see if the bootstrapped distribution is bell-shaped. Classes like Data 140 investigate this idea in great detail.\n",
    "<!-- The CLT states that no matter what population you are drawing from, if an i.i.d. sample of size $n$ is large, the probability distribution of the sample mean is roughly normal with mean ùúá and SD $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$. -->\n",

    "## Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in the course, we've spent a great deal of time working with models. When we first introduced the idea of modeling a few weeks ago, we did so in the context of **prediction**: using models to make *accurate predictions* about unseen data. Another reason we might build models is to better understand complex phenomena in the world around us. **Inference** is the task of using a model to infer the true underlying relationships between the feature and response variables. For example, if we are working with a set of housing data, *prediction* might ask: given the attributes of a house, how much is it worth? *Inference* might ask: how much does having a local park impact the value of a house?\n",
    "\n",
    "A major goal of inference is to draw conclusions about the full population of data given only a random sample. To do this, we aim to estimate the value of a **parameter**, which is a numerical function of the *population* (for example, the population mean $\\mu$). We use a collected sample to construct a **statistic**, which is a numerical function of the random *sample* (for example, the sample mean $\\bar{X}_n$). It's helpful to think \"p\" for \"parameter\" and \"population,\" and \"s\" for \"sample\" and \"statistic.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the sample represents a *random* subset of the population, any statistic we generate will likely deviate from the true population parameter, and it *could have been different*. We say that the sample statistic is an **estimator** of the true population parameter. Notationally, the population parameter is typically called $\\theta$, while its estimator is denoted by $\\hat{\\theta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address our inference question, we aim to construct estimators that closely estimate the value of the population parameter. We evaluate how \"good\" an estimator is by answering three questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How close is our answer to the parameter? **(Risk / MSE)**\n",
    "  $$ MSE(\\hat{\\theta}) = E[(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta)]^2$$\n",
    "* Do we get the right answer for the parameter, on average? **(Bias)** \n",
    "  $$\\text{Bias}(\\hat{\\theta}) = E[\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta] = E[\\hat{\\theta}] - \\theta$$\n",
    "* How variable is the answer? **(Variance)**\n",
    "  $$Var(\\hat{\\theta}) = E[(\\hat{\\theta} - E[\\hat{\\theta}])^2] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Bias of an estimator $\\hat{theta}$ is **zero**, then it is said to be an **unbiased estimator**. For example, sample mean is unbiased for the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship between bias and variance can be illustrated with an archery analogy. Imagine that the center of the target is the $\\theta$ and each arrow corresponds to a separate parameter estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bias_v_variance.png\" width='600'>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we want our estimator to have low bias and low variance, but how can we mathematically quantify that? See @sec-bias-variance-tradeoff for more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction as a Data-Generating Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've established the idea of an estimator, let's see how we can apply this learning to the modeling process. To do so, we'll take a moment to formalize our data collection and models in the language of random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we are working with an input variable, $x$, and a response variable, $Y$. We assume that $Y$ and $x$ are linked by some relationship $g$; in other words, $Y = g(x)$ where $g$ represents some \"universal truth\" or \"law of nature\" that defines the **true underlying relationship** between $x$ and $Y$. In the image below, $g$ is denoted by the red line.\n",
    "\n",
    "As data scientists, however, we have no way of directly \"seeing\" the underlying relationship $g$. The best we can do is collect observed data out in the real world to try to understand this relationship. Unfortunately, the data collection process will always have some inherent error (think of the randomness you might encounter when taking measurements in a scientific experiment). We say that each observation comes with some **random error or noise** term, $\\epsilon$ (read: \"epsilon\"). This error is assumed to be a random variable with expectation $\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon)=0$, variance $\\text{Var}(\\epsilon) = \\sigma^2$, and be i.i.d. across each observation. The existence of this random noise means that our observations, $Y(x)$, are *random variables*, where $Y = g(x) + \\epsilon$ is the data-generating process. This can be seen on our graph because the points do not line perfectly with the true underlying relationship, and the residual is the noise $\\epsilon$.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can only observe our **IID random sample of data**, represented by the blue points above. From this sample, we want to estimate the true relationship $g$. We do this by **training** a model on the data to obtain our optimal $\\hat{\\theta}$,\n",
