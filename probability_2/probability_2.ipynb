        "In the last lecture, we talked at length about the concept of a distribution – a statement of all possible values that a random variable can take, as well as the probability of the variable taking on each value. Let's take a moment to refine this definition.\n",

        "\n",
        "In data science, we seldom have access to the entire population we wish to investigate. If we want to understand the distribution of a random variable across the population, we often need to use the distribution of collected samples to *infer* the properties of the population. For example, say we wish to understand the distribution of heights of people across the US population. We can't directly survey every single person in the country, so we might instead take smaller samples of heights and use these samples to estimate the population's distribution. \n",

        "\n",
        "In [Data 8](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/4/Central_Limit_Theorem.html?), you encountered the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**. This is a powerful theorem for estimating the distribution of a population with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ from a collection of smaller samples. The CLT tells us that if an IID sample of size $n$ is large, then the probability distribution of the sample mean is **roughly normal with mean $\\mu$ and SD $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$**. In simpler terms, this means:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Draw a sample of size $n$ from the population\n",
        "* Compute the mean of this sample; call it $\\bar{X}_n$\n",

        "\n",
        "Importantly, the CLT assumes that each observation in our samples is drawn IID from the distribution of the population. In addition, the CLT is accurate only when $n$ is \"large.\" What counts as a \"large\" sample size depends on the specific distribution. If a population is highly symmetric and unimodal, we could need as few as $n=20$; if a population is very skewed, we need a larger $n$. Classes like Data 140 investigate this idea in great detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is this helpful? Consider what might happen if we estimated the population distribution from just *one* sample. If we happened, by random chance, to draw a sample with a different mean or spread than that of the population, we might get a skewed view of how the population behaves (consider the extreme case where we happen to sample the exact same value $n$ times!). By drawing many samples, we can consider how the sample distribution varies across multiple subsets of the data. This allows us to approximate the properties of the population without the need to survey every single member. \n",

We use a collected sample to construct a **statistic**, which is a numerical function of the random *sample* (for example, the sample mean $\\bar{X}_n$). It's helpful to think \"p\" for \"parameter\" and \"population,\" and \"s\" for \"sample\" and \"statistic.\"\n",

It turns out that this last assumption is very important. If variables in our model are somehow related to one another, then it might not be possible to have a change in one of them while holding the others constant. This means that our interpretation framework is no longer valid! In the models we fit above, we incorporated `egg_length`, `egg_breadth`, and `egg_weight` as input variables. These variables are very likely related to one another – an egg with large `egg_length` and `egg_breadth` will likely be heavy in `egg_weight`. This means that the model parameters cannot be meaningfully interpreted as slopes. \n",
