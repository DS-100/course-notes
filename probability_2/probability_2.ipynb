As such, we need to collect a sample and use its distribution to estimate or infer properties of the population. In cases like these, we can take several samples of size $n$ from the population (an easy way to do this is using `df.sample(n, replace=True)`), and compute the mean of each *sample*. When sampling, we make the (big) assumption that we sample uniformly at random *with replacement* from the population; each observation in our sample is a random variable drawn i.i.d from our population distribution. Remember that our sample mean is a random variable since it depends on our randomly drawn sample! On the other hand, our population mean is simply a number (a fixed value).\n",

    "This is a powerful theorem for estimating the distribution of a population with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ from a collection of smaller samples. The CLT tells us that if an i.i.d sample of size $n$ is large, then the probability distribution of the **sample mean** is **roughly normal** with mean $\\mu$ and SD of $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$. More generally, any theorem that provides the rough distribution of a statistic and **doesn't need the distribution of the population** is valuable to data scientists! This is because we rarely know a lot about the population. \n",

    "Importantly, the CLT assumes that each observation in our samples is drawn i.i.d from the distribution of the population. In addition, the CLT is accurate only when $n$ is \"large\", but what counts as a \"large\" sample size depends on the specific distribution. If a population is highly symmetric and unimodal, we could need as few as $n=20$; if a population is very skewed, we need a larger $n$. If in doubt, you can bootstrap the sample mean and see if the bootstrapped distribution is bell-shaped. Classes like Data 140 investigate this idea in great detail.\n",
    "<!-- The CLT states that no matter what population you are drawing from, if an i.i.d. sample of size $n$ is large, the probability distribution of the sample mean is roughly normal with mean ùúá and SD $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$. -->\n",

    "### Using the Sample Mean to Estimate the Population Mean\n",
    "Now let's say we want to use the sample mean to **estimate** the population mean, for example, the average height of Cal undergraduates. We can typically collect a **single sample**, which has just one average. However, what if we happened, by random chance, to draw a sample with a different mean or spread than that of the population? We might get a skewed view of how the population behaves (consider the extreme case where we happen to sample the exact same value $n$ times!). \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, notice the difference in variation between these two distributions that are different in sample size. The distribution with a bigger sample size ($n=800$) is tighter around the mean than the distribution with a smaller sample size ($n=200$). Try plugging in these values into the standard deviation equation for the sample mean to make sense of this! \n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the CLT allows us to make sense of all of this and resolve this issue. By drawing many samples, we can consider how the sample distribution varies across multiple subsets of the data. This allows us to approximate the properties of the population without the need to survey every single member. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given this potential variance, it is also important that we consider the **average value and spread** of all possible sample means, and what this means for how big $n$ should be. For every sample size, the expected value of the sample mean is the population mean: $$\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}_n] = \\mu$$ We call the sample mean an **unbiased estimator** of the population mean and will explore this idea more in the next lecture. \n",

    "The square root law ([Data 8](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/5/Variability_of_the_Sample_Mean.html#the-square-root-law)) states that if you increase the sample size by a factor, the SD of the sample mean decreases by the square root of the factor. $$\\text{SD}(\\bar{X_n}) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$$ The sample mean is more likely to be close to the population mean if we have a larger sample size.\n",

    "## Prediction and Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in the course, we've spent a great deal of time working with models. When we first introduced the idea of modeling a few weeks ago, we did so in the context of **prediction**: using models to make *accurate predictions* about unseen data. Another reason we might build models is to better understand complex phenomena in the world around us. **Inference** is the task of using a model to infer the true underlying relationships between the feature and response variables. For example, if we are working with a set of housing data, *prediction* might ask: given the attributes of a house, how much is it worth? *Inference* might ask: how much does having a local park impact the value of a house?\n",
    "\n",
    "A major goal of inference is to draw conclusions about the full population of data given only a random sample. To do this, we aim to estimate the value of a **parameter**, which is a numerical function of the *population* (for example, the population mean $\\mu$). We use a collected sample to construct a **statistic**, which is a numerical function of the random *sample* (for example, the sample mean $\\bar{X}_n$). It's helpful to think \"p\" for \"parameter\" and \"population,\" and \"s\" for \"sample\" and \"statistic.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the sample represents a *random* subset of the population, any statistic we generate will likely deviate from the true population parameter, and it *could have been different*. We say that the sample statistic is an **estimator** of the true population parameter. Notationally, the population parameter is typically called $\\theta$, while its estimator is denoted by $\\hat{\\theta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address our inference question, we aim to construct estimators that closely estimate the value of the population parameter. We evaluate how \"good\" an estimator is by answering three questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How close is our answer to the parameter? **(Risk / MSE)**\n",
    "  $$ MSE(\\hat{\\theta}) = E[(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta)]^2$$\n",
    "* Do we get the right answer for the parameter, on average? **(Bias)** \n",
    "  $$\\text{Bias}(\\hat{\\theta}) = E[\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta] = E[\\hat{\\theta}] - \\theta$$\n",
    "* How variable is the answer? **(Variance)**\n",
    "  $$Var(\\hat{\\theta}) = E[(\\theta - E[\\theta])^2] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship can be illustrated with an archery analogy. Imagine that the center of the target is the $\\theta$ and each arrow corresponds to a separate parameter estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$\n",

    "### Prediction as Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've established the idea of an estimator, let's see how we can apply this learning to the modeling process. To do so, we'll take a moment to formalize our data collection and models in the language of random variables.\n",

In the image below, $g$ is denoted by the red line.\n",
    "\n",
    "As data scientists, however, we have no way of directly \"seeing\" the underlying relationship $g$. The best we can do is collect observed data out in the real world to try to understand this relationship. Unfortunately, the data collection process will always have some inherent error (think of the randomness you might encounter when taking measurements in a scientific experiment). We say that each observation comes with some random error or **noise** term, $\\epsilon$ (read: \"epsilon\"). This error is assumed to be a random variable with expectation $\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon)=0$, variance $\\text{Var}(\\epsilon) = \\sigma^2$, and be i.i.d. across each observation.

    "#### Observation Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term in the above decomposition is $E[\\epsilon^2]$. Remember $\\epsilon$ is the random noise when observing $Y$, with expectation $\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon)=0$ and variance $\\text{Var}(\\epsilon) = \\sigma^2$. We can show that $E[\\epsilon^2]$ is the variance of $\\epsilon$:\n",

    "This term describes how variable the random error $\\epsilon$ (and $Y$) is for each observation. This is called the **observation variance**. It exists due to the randomness in our observations $Y$. It is a form of *chance error* we talked about in the Sampling lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{observation variance} = \\text{Var}(\\epsilon) = \\sigma^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The observation variance results from measurement errors when observing data or missing information that acts like noise. To reduce this observation variance, we could try to get more precise measurements, but it is often beyond the control of data scientists. Because of this, the observation variance $\\sigma^2$ is sometimes called \"irreducible error.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then look at the last term: $E\\left[\\left(E\\left[\\hat{Y}(x)\\right] - \\hat{Y}(x)\\right)^2\\right]$. If you recall the definition of variance from the last lecture, this is precisely $\\text{Var}(\\hat{Y}(x))$. We call this the **model variance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It describes how much the prediction $\\hat{Y}(x)$ tends to vary when we fit the model on different samples. Remember the sample we collect can come out very differently, thus the prediction $\\hat{Y}(x)$ will also be different. The model variance describes this variability due to the randomness in our sampling process. Like observation variance, it is also a form of *chance error*‚Äîeven though the sources of randomness are different.\n",

    "$$\\text{model variance} = \\text{Var}(\\hat{Y}(x)) = E\\left[\\left(\\hat{Y}(x) - E\\left[\\hat{Y}(x)\\right]\\right)^2\\right]$$\n",

    "The main reason for the large model variance is because of **overfitting**: we paid too much attention to the details in our sample that small differences in our random sample lead to large differences in the fitted model. To remediate this, we try to reduce model complexity (e.g. take out some features and limit the magnitude of estimated model coefficients) and not fit our model on the noises.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the second term is $\\left(g(x)-E\\left[\\hat{Y}(x)\\right]\\right)^2$. What is this? The term $E\\left[\\hat{Y}(x)\\right] - g(x)$ is called the **model bias**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that $g(x)$ is the fixed underlying truth and $\\hat{Y}(x)$ is our fitted model, which is random. Model bias therefore measures how far off $g(x)$ and $\\hat{Y}(x)$ are on average over all possible samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{model bias} = E\\left[\\hat{Y}(x) - g(x)\\right] = E\\left[\\hat{Y}(x)\\right] - g(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The model bias is not random; it's an average measure for a specific individual $x$. If bias is positive, our model tends to overestimate $g(x)$; if it's negative, our model tends to underestimate $g(x)$. And if it's 0, we can say that our model is **unbiased**.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-tip}\n",
    "##### Unbiased Estimators \n",
    "\n",
    "An **unbiased model** has a $\\text{model bias } = 0$. In other words, our model predicts $g(x)$ on average. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can define bias for estimators like the mean. The sample mean is an **unbiased estimator** of the population mean, as by CLT, $\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}_n] = \\mu$. Therefore, the $\\text{estimator bias } = \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}_n] - \\mu = 0$.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main reasons for large model biases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Underfitting: our model is too simple for the data\n",
    "- Lack of domain knowledge: we don't understand what features are useful for the response variable\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, we increase model complexity (but we don't want to overfit!) or consult domain experts to see which models make sense. You can start to see a tradeoff here: if we increase model complexity, we decrease the model bias, but we also risk increasing the model variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Decomposition\n",
    "To summarize: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The **model risk**, $\\mathbb{E}\\left[(Y(x)-\\hat{Y}(x))^2\\right]$, is the mean squared prediction error of the model. It is an expectation and is therefore a **fixed number** (for a given x).\n",
    "* The **observation variance**, $\\sigma^2$, is the variance of the random noise in the observations. It describes how variable the random error $\\epsilon$ is for each observation and **cannot be addressed by modeling**.\n",
    "* The **model bias**, $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\hat{Y}(x)\\right]-g(x)$, is how \"off\" the $\\hat{Y}(x)$ is as an estimator of the true underlying relationship $g(x)$. \n",
    "* The **model variance**, $\\text{Var}(\\hat{Y}(x))$, describes how much the prediction $\\hat{Y}(x)$ tends to vary when we fit the model on different samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above definitions enable us to simplify the decomposition of model risk before as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E[(Y(x) - \\hat{Y}(x))^2] = \\sigma^2 + (E[\\hat{Y}(x)] - g(x))^2 + \\text{Var}(\\hat{Y}(x)) $$\n",
    "$$\\text{model risk } = \\text{observation variance} + (\\text{model bias})^2 \\text{+ model variance}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the **bias-variance tradeoff**. What does it mean? Remember that the model risk is a measure of the model's performance. Our goal in building models is to keep model risk low; this means that we will want to ensure that each component of model risk is kept at a small value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Observation variance is an inherent, random part of the data collection process. We aren't able to reduce the observation variance, so we'll focus our attention on the model bias and model variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Feature Engineering lecture, we considered the issue of overfitting. We saw that the model's error or bias tends to decrease as model complexity increases ‚Äî if we design a highly complex model, it will tend to make predictions that are closer to the true relationship $g$. At the same time, model variance tends to *increase* as model complexity increases; a complex model may overfit to the training data, meaning that small differences in the random samples used for training lead to large differences in the fitted model. We have a problem. To decrease model bias, we could increase the model's complexity, which would lead to overfitting and an increase in model variance. Alternatively, we could decrease model variance by decreasing the model's complexity at the cost of increased model bias due to underfitting. \n",

    "We need to strike a balance. Our goal in model creation is to use a complexity level that is high enough to keep bias low, but not so high that model variance is large."
