        "Last time, we introduced the idea of random variables: numerical functions of a sample. Most of our work in the last lecture was done to build a background in probability and statistics. Now that we've established some key ideas, we're in a good place to apply what we've learned to our original goal – understanding how the randomness of a sample impacts the model design process. \n",

        "In the last lecture, we talked at length about the concept of a distribution – a statement of all possible values that a random variable can take, as well as the probability of the variable taking on each value. Let's take a moment to refine this definition.\n",

        "\n",
        "In data science, we seldom have access to the entire population we wish to investigate. If we want to understand the distribution of a random variable across the population, we often need to use the distribution of collected samples to *infer* the properties of the population. For example, say we wish to understand the distribution of heights of people across the US population. We can't directly survey every single person in the country, so we might instead take smaller samples of heights and use these samples to estimate the population's distribution. \n",
        "\n",
        "A common situation is wishing to know the mean of a population (eg the average height of all people in the US). In this case, we can take several samples of size $n$ from the population, and compute the mean of each *sample*. \n",
        "\n",
        "In [Data 8](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/4/Central_Limit_Theorem.html?), you encountered the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**. This is a powerful theorem for estimating the distribution of a population with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ from a collection of smaller samples. The CLT tells us that if an IID sample of size $n$ is large, then the probability distribution of the sample mean is **roughly normal with mean $\\mu$ and SD $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$**. In simpler terms, this means:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Draw a sample of size $n$ from the population\n",
        "* Compute the mean of this sample; call it $\\bar{X}_n$\n",
        "* Repeat this process: draw many more samples and compute the mean of each\n",
        "* The distribution of these sample means is normal with standard deviation $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$ and mean equal to the population mean, $\\mu$\n",

        "<img src=\"images/clt.png\" alt='clt' width='600'>\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, the CLT assumes that each observation in our samples is drawn IID from the distribution of the population. In addition, the CLT is accurate only when $n$ is \"large.\" What counts as a \"large\" sample size depends on the specific distribution. If a population is highly symmetric and unimodal, we could need as few as $n=20$; if a population is very skewed, we need a larger $n$. Classes like Data 140 investigate this idea in great detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is this helpful? Consider what might happen if we estimated the population distribution from just *one* sample. If we happened, by random chance, to draw a sample with a different mean or spread than that of the population, we might get a skewed view of how the population behaves (consider the extreme case where we happen to sample the exact same value $n$ times!). By drawing many samples, we can consider how the sample distribution varies across multiple subsets of the data. This allows us to approximate the properties of the population without the need to survey every single member. \n",

        "\n",
        "Notice the difference in variation between the two distributions that are different in sample size. The distribution with bigger sample size ($n=800$) is tighter around the mean than the distribution with smaller sample size ($n=200$). Try plugging in these values into the standard deviation equation for the normal distribution to make sense of this! \n",

        "At this point in the course, we've spent a great deal of time working with models. When we first introduced the idea of modeling a few weeks ago, we did so in the context of **prediction**: using models to make predictions about unseen data. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another reason we might build models is to better understand complex phenomena in the world around us. **Inference** is the task of using a model to infer the true underlying relationships between the feature and response variables. If we are working with a set of housing data, *prediction* might ask: given the attributes of a house, how much is it worth? *Inference* might ask: how much does having a local park impact the value of a house?\n",
        "\n",
        "A major goal of inference is to draw conclusions about the full population of data, given only a random sample. To do this, we aim to estimate the value of a **parameter**, which is a numerical function of the *population* (for example, the population mean $\\mu$). We use a collected sample to construct a **statistic**, which is a numerical function of the random *sample* (for example, the sample mean $\\bar{X}_n$). It's helpful to think \"p\" for \"parameter\" and \"population,\" and \"s\" for \"sample\" and \"statistic.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the sample represents a random subset of the population, any statistic we generate will likely deviate from the true population parameter. We say that the sample statistic is an **estimator** of the true population parameter. Notationally, the population parameter is typically called $\\theta$, while its estimator is denoted by $\\hat{\\theta}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address our inference question, we aim to construct estimators that closely estimate the value of the population parameter. We evaluate how \"good\" an estimator is by answering three questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Do we get the right answer for the parameter, on average?\n",
