    "Last time, we introduced the modeling process. We set up a framework to predict target variables as functions of our features, following a set workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a model - how should we represent the world?\n",
    "2. Choose a loss function - how do we quantify prediction error?\n",
    "3. Fit the model - how do we choose the best parameter of our model given our data?\n",
    "4. Evaluate model performance - how do we evaluate whether this process gave rise to a good model?\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this process, we derived the optimal model parameters under simple linear regression (SLR) with mean squared error (MSE) as the cost function. A summary of the SLR modeling process is shown below:\n",

    "At the end of last lecture, we dived deeper into step 4 - evaluating model performance - using SLR as an example. In this lecture, we'll also explore the modeling process with new models, continue familiarizing ourselves with the modeling process by finding the best model parameters under a new model, the constant model, and test out two different loss functions to understand how our choice of loss influences model design. Later on, we'll consider what happens when a linear model isn't the best choice to capture trends in our data and what solutions there are to create better models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the modeling process, let's quickly review some important terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constant Model + MSE\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll shift from the SLR model to the **constant model**, also known as a summary statistic. The constant model is slightly different from the simple linear regression model we've explored previously. Rather than generating predictions from an inputted feature variable, the constant model always *predicts the same constant number*. This ignores any relationships between variables. For example, let's say we want to predict the number of drinks a boba shop sells in a day. Boba tea sales likely depend on the time of year, the weather, how the customers feel, whether school is in session, etc., but the constant model ignores these factors in favor of a simpler model. In other words, the constant model employs a **simplifying assumption**. It often serves as a baseline to compare other more complicated models against. If a complex model has comparable or worse performance compared to a very simple constant model, it might call into question how useful the other features in the more complex model really are.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also a parametric, statistical model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\theta_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\theta_0$ is the parameter of the constant model, just as $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ were the parameters in SLR.\n",
    "Since our parameter $\\theta_0$ is 1-dimensional ($\\theta_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$), we now have no input to our model and will always predict $\\hat{y} = \\theta_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deriving the optimal $\\theta_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task now is to determine what value of $\\theta_0$ best represents the optimal model – in other words, what number should we guess each time to have the lowest possible **average loss** on our data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like before, we'll use Mean Squared Error (MSE). Recall that the MSE is average squared loss (L2 loss) over the data $D = \\{y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\\}$.\n",

    "- **Variance, $\\sigma_y^2$**: This term represents the spread of the data points around their mean, $\\bar{y}$, and is a measure of the data's inherent variability. Importantly, it does not depend on the choice of $\\theta$, meaning it's a fixed property of the data. Variance serves as an indicator of the data's dispersion and is crucial in understanding the dataset's structure, but it remains constant regardless of how we adjust our model parameter $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias Squared, $(\\bar{y} - \\theta)^2$**: This term captures the bias of the estimator, defined as the square of the difference between the mean of the data points, $\\bar{y}$, and the parameter $\\theta$. The bias quantifies the systematic error introduced when estimating $\\theta$. Minimizing this term is essential for improving the accuracy of the estimator. When $\\theta = \\bar{y}$, the bias is $0$, indicating that the estimator is unbiased for the parameter it estimates. This highlights a critical principle in statistical estimation: choosing $\\theta$ to be the sample mean, $\\bar{y}$, minimizes the average loss, rendering the estimator both efficient and unbiased for the population mean.\n"
