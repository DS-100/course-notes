        "The terms prediction and estimation are often used somewhat interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between them. **Estimation** is the task of using data to calculate model parameters. **Prediction** is the task of using a model to predict outputs for unseen data. In our simple linear regression model\n",

        "Now that we've explored the mathematics behind (1) choosing a model, (2) choosing a loss function, and (3) fitting the model, we're left with one final question – how \"good\" are the predictions made by this \"best\" fitted model? To determine this, we can:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Visualize data and compute statistics:\n",
        "   - Plot the original data.\n",
        "   - Compute each column's mean and standard deviation. If the mean and standard deviation of our predictions are close to those of the original observed $y_i$s, we might be inclined to say that our model has done well.\n",
        "   - (If we're fitting a linear model) compute the correlation $r$. A large magnitude for the correlation coefficient between the feature and response variables could also indicate that our model has done well.\n",
        "2. Performance metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - We can take the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.\n",
        "     - It's the square root of the mean squared error (MSE), which is the average loss that we've been minimizing to determine optimal model parameters.\n",
        "     - RMSE is in the same units as $y$.\n",
        "     - A lower RMSE indicates more \"accurate\" predictions, as we have a lower \"average loss\" across the data.\n",
        "\n",

For example, let's say we want to predict the number of drinks a boba shop sells in a day. Boba tea sales likely depend on the time of year, the weather, how the customers feel, whether school is in session, etc., but the constant model ignores these factors in favor of a simpler model.

Importantly, it does not depend on the choice of $\\theta$, meaning it's a fixed property of the data. Variance serves as an indicator of the data's dispersion and is crucial in understanding the dataset's structure, but it remains constant regardless of how we adjust our model parameter $\\theta$.\n",

The bias quantifies the systematic error introduced when estimating $\\theta$. Minimizing this term is essential for improving the accuracy of the estimator. When $\\theta = \\bar{y}$, the bias is zero, indicating that the estimator is unbiased for the parameter it estimates. This highlights a critical principle in statistical estimation: choosing $\\theta$ to be the sample mean, $\\bar{y}$, minimizes the average loss, rendering the estimator both efficient and unbiased for the population mean.\n"
