## About the Course Notes

This text was developed for the Spring 2023 Edition of the UC Berkeley course Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science. The concepts and content are attributed to the _Learning Data Science_ textbook by Sam Lau, Joey Gonzalez, and Deb Nolan; see [here](https://ds100.org/sp23/acks/) for full acknowledgments. Compiled by Bella Crouch, Kanu Grover, and the Data 100 Spring 2023 course staff.

As this project is in development during the Spring 2023 semester, the course notes may be in flux. We appreciate your understanding. If you spot any errors or would like to suggest any changes, please email us. <br /> <br /> **Email**: data100.instructors@berkeley.edu
