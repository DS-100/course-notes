    "We've seen now that feature engineering allows us to build all sorts of features to improve the performance of the model. In particular, we saw that designing a more complex feature (squaring `\"hp\"` in the `vehicles` data previously) substantially improved the model's ability to capture non-linear relationships. To take full advantage of this, we might be inclined to design increasingly complex features. Consider the following three models, each of different order (the maximum exponent power of each model):\n",

    "* Model with order 1: $\\hat{\\text{mpg}} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 (\\text{hp})$\n",
    "* Model with order 2: $\\hat{\\text{mpg}} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 (\\text{hp}) + \\theta_2 (\\text{hp})^2$\n",
    "* Model with order 4: $\\hat{\\text{mpg}} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 (\\text{hp}) + \\theta_2 (\\text{hp})^2 + \\theta_3 (\\text{hp})^3 + \\theta_4 (\\text{hp})^4$\n",

    "When we use our model to make predictions on the same data that was used to fit the model, we find that the MSE decreases with increasingly complex models. The **training error** is the model's error when generating predictions from the same data that was used for training purposes. We can conclude that the training error goes down as the complexity of the model increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/train_error.png\" alt='train_error' width='500'>\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems like good news – when working on the **training data**, we can improve model performance by designing increasingly complex models. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, high model complexity comes with its own set of issues. When a model has many complicated features, it becomes increasingly sensitive to the data used to fit it. Even a small variation in the data points used to train the model may result in wildly different results for the fitted model. The plots below illustrate this idea. In each case, we've fit a model to two very similar sets of data (in fact, they only differ by two data points!). Notice that the model with order 2 appears roughly the same across the two sets of data; in contrast, the model with order 4 changes erratically across the two datasets.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/model_variance.png\" alt='model_variance' width='600'>\n",

    "The sensitivity of the model to the data used to train it is called the **model variance**. As we saw above, model variance tends to increase with model complexity. \n",

    "## Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that there is a clear \"trade-off\" that comes from the complexity of our model. As model complexity increases, the model's error on the training data decreases. At the same time, the model's variance tends to increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does this matter? To answer this question, let's take a moment to review our modeling workflow when making predictions on new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample a dataset of training data from the real world\n",
    "2. Use this training data to fit a model\n",
    "3. Apply this fitted model to generate predictions on unseen data \n",
    "\n",
    "This first step – sampling training data – is important to remember in our analysis. As we saw above, a highly complex model may produce results that vary wildly across different samples of training data. If we happen to sample a set of training data that is a poor representation of the population we are trying to model, our model may perform poorly on any new set of data it has not seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why, consider a model fit using the training data shown on the left. Because the model is so complex, it achieves zero error on the training set – it perfectly predicts each value in the training data! When we go to use this model to make predictions on a new sample of data, however, things aren't so good. The model now has enormous error on the unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/overfit.png\" alt='overfit' width='600'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The phenomenon above is called **overfitting**. The model effectively just memorized the training data it encountered when it was fitted, leaving it unable to handle new situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The takeaway here: we need to strike a balance in the complexity of our models. A model that is too simple won't be able to capture the key relationships between our variables of interest; a model that is too complex runs the risk of overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "This begs the question: how do we control the complexity of a model? Stay tuned for the next lecture.\n"
