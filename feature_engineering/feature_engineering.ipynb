    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in the course, we've equipped ourselves with some powerful techniques to build and optimize models. We've explored how to develop models of multiple variables, as well as how to transform variables to help **linearize** a dataset and fit these models to maximize their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this was done with one major caveat: the regression models we've worked with so far are all **linear in the input variables**. We've assumed that our predictions should be some combination of linear variables. While this works well in some cases, the real world isn't always so straightforward. We'll learn an important method to address this issue – feature engineering – and consider some new problems that can arise when we do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is the process of *transforming* raw features into *more informative features* that can be used in modeling or EDA tasks and improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Capture domain knowledge \n",
    "* Express non-linear relationships using linear models\n",
    "* Use non-numeric features in models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **feature function** describes the transformations we apply to raw features in a dataset to create a design matrix of transformed features. We typically denote the feature function as $\\Phi$ (think to yourself: \"phi\"-ture function). When we apply the feature function to our original dataset $\\mathbb{X}$, the result, $\\Phi(\\mathbb{X})$, is a transformed design matrix ready to be used in modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might design a feature function that computes the square of an existing feature and adds it to the design matrix. In this case, our existing matrix $[x]$ is transformed to $[x, x^2]$. Its *dimension* increases from 1 to 2. Often, the dimension of the *featurized* dataset increases as seen here.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/phi.png\" alt='phi' width='700'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The new features introduced by the feature function can then be used in modeling. Often, we use the symbol $\\phi_i$ to represent transformed features after feature engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\theta_1 x + \\theta_2 x^2$$\n",
    "$$\\hat{y}= \\theta_1 \\phi_1 + \\theta_2 \\phi_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In matrix notation, the symbol $\\Phi$ is sometimes used to denote the design matrix after feature engineering has been performed. Note that in the usage below, $\\Phi$ is now a feature-engineered matrix, rather than a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\mathbb{Y}} = \\Phi \\theta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, we describe a feature function as transforming the original $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ dataset $\\mathbb{X}$ to a featurized $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p'}$ dataset $\\mathbb{\\Phi}$, where $p'$ is typically greater than $p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p} \\longrightarrow \\Phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p'}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## One Hot Encoding\n",
    "Feature engineering opens up a whole new set of possibilities for designing better-performing models. As you will see in lab and homework, feature engineering is one of the most important parts of the entire modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly powerful use of feature engineering is to allow us to perform regression on *non-numeric* features. **One hot encoding** is a feature engineering technique that generates numeric features from categorical data, allowing us to use our usual methods to fit a regression model on the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how this works, we'll refer back to the `tips` dataset from previous lectures. Consider the `\"day\"` column of the dataset:"

    "Looking a lot better! By incorporating a squared feature, we are able to capture the curvature of the dataset. Our model is now a parabola centered on our data. Notice that our new model's error has decreased relative to the original model with linear features. .\n",

    "## Complexity and Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen now that feature engineering allows us to build all sorts of features to improve the performance of the model. In particular, we saw that designing a more complex feature (squaring `hp` in the `vehicles` data previously) substantially improved the model's ability to capture non-linear relationships. To take full advantage of this, we might be inclined to design increasingly complex features. Consider the following three models, each of different order (the maximum exponent power of each model):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model with order 2: $\\hat{\\text{mpg}} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 (\\text{hp}) + \\theta_2 (\\text{hp}^2)$\n",

    "* Model with order 4: $\\hat{\\text{mpg}} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 (\\text{hp}) + \\theta_2 (\\text{hp}^2) + \\theta_3 (\\text{hp}^3) + \\theta_4 (\\text{hp}^4)$\n",

    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/degree_comparison.png\" alt='degree_comparison' width='900'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see in the plots above, MSE continues to decrease with each additional polynomial term. To visualize it further, let's plot models as the complexity increases from 0 to 6: \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/degree_comparison2.png\" alt='degree_comparison' width='900'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use our model to make predictions on the same data that was used to fit the model, we find that the MSE decreases with each additional polynomial term (as our model gets more complex). The **training error** is the model's error when generating predictions from the same data that was used for training purposes. We can conclude that the training error goes down as the complexity of the model increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/train_error.png\" alt='train_error' width='400'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems like good news – when working on the **training data**, we can improve model performance by designing increasingly complex models. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Math Fact**: given $N$ overlapping data points, we can always find a polynomial of degree $N-1$ that goes through all those points.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> For example: there always exists a degree-4 polynomial curve that can perfectly model a dataset of 5 datapoints\n",
    "> <center><img src=\"images/perfect_poly_fits.png\" alt='train_error' width='600'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, high model complexity comes with its own set of issues. When building the `vehicles` models above, we trained the models on the *entire* dataset and then evaluated their performance on this same dataset. In reality, we are likely to instead train the model on a *sample* from the population, then use it to make predictions on data it didn't encounter during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through a more realistic example. Say we are given a training dataset of just 6 datapoints and want to train a model to then make predictions on a *different* set of points. We may be tempted to make a highly complex model (e.g., degree 5), especially given it makes perfect predictions on the training data as clear on the left. However, as shown in the graph on the right, this model would perform *horribly* on the rest of the population! \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/complex.png\" alt='complex' width='600'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The phenomenon above is called **overfitting**. The model effectively just memorized the training data it encountered when it was fitted, leaving it unable to **generalize** well to data it didn't encounter during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, since complex models are sensitive to the specific dataset used to train them, they have high **variance**. A model with high variance tends to *vary* more dramatically when trained on different datasets. Going back to our example above, we can see our degree-5 model varies erratically when we fit it to different samples of 6 points from `vehicles`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/resamples.png\" alt='resamples' width='800'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We now face a dilemma: we know that we can **decrease training error** by increasing model complexity, but models that are *too* complex start to overfit and can't be reapplied to new datasets due to **high variance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/bvt.png\" alt='bvt' width='400'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that there is a clear trade-off that comes from the complexity of our model. As model complexity increases, the model's error on the training data decreases. At the same time, the model's variance tends to increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The takeaway here: we need to strike a balance in the complexity of our models; we want models that are generalizable to \"unseen\" data. A model that is too simple won't be able to capture the key relationships between our variables of interest; a model that is too complex runs the risk of overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "This begs the question: how do we control the complexity of a model? Stay tuned for our Lecture 16 on Cross-Validation and Regularization!"
