The sampling strategy is generally without replacement (data is shuffled and batch size examples are selected one at a time.)\n",

In contrast, stochastic gradient descent involve an element of randomness. Since only a subset of the full data is used to update the guess for $\\vec{\\theta}$ at each iteration, there's a chance the algorithm will not progress towards the true minimum of loss with each update. Over the longer term, these stochastic techniques should still converge towards the optimal solution. \n",

    "All of this was done with one major caveat: the regression models we've worked with so far are all **linear in the input variables**. We've assumed that our predictions should be some combination of linear variables. While this works well in some cases, the real world isn't always so straightforward. We'll learn an important method to address this issue – feature engineering – and consider some new problems that can arise when we do so.\n",

    "Feature engineering is the process of *transforming* raw features into *more informative features* that can be used in modeling or EDA tasks and improve model performance.\n",

    "A **feature function** describes the transformations we apply to raw features in a dataset to create a design matrix of transformed features (typically denoted as $\\Phi$). When we apply the feature function to our original dataset $\\mathbb{X}$, the result, $\\Phi(\\mathbb{X})$, is a transformed design matrix ready to be used in modeling. \n",

    "For example, we might design a feature function that computes the square of an existing feature and adds it to the design matrix. In this case, our existing matrix $[x]$ is transformed to $[x, x^2]$. Its *dimension* increases from 1 to 2. Often, the dimension of the *featurized* dataset increases as seen here.\n",

    "In matrix notation, the symbol $\\Phi$ is sometimes used to denote the design matrix after feature engineering has been performed. Note that in the usage below, $\\Phi$ is now a feature-engineered matrix, rather than a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\mathbb{Y}} = \\Phi \\theta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, we describe a feature function as transforming the original $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ dataset $\\mathbb{X}$ to a featurized $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p'}$ dataset $\\mathbb{\\Phi}$, where $p'$ is typically greater than $p$. \n",

    "A particularly powerful use of feature engineering is to allow us to perform regression on non-numeric features. **One-hot encoding** is a feature engineering technique that generates numeric features from categorical data, allowing us to use our usual methods to fit a regression model on the data.\n",

To take full advantage of this, we might be inclined to design increasingly complex features. Consider the following three models, each of different order (the maximum exponent power of each model):\n",

The **training error** is the model's error when generating predictions from the same data that was used for training purposes. We can conclude that the training error goes down as the complexity of the model increases. \n",

    "However, high model complexity comes with its own set of issues. When building the `vehicles` models above, we trained the models on the *entire* dataset and then evaluated their performance on this same dataset. In reality, we are likely to instead train the model on a *sample* from the population, then use it to make predictions on data it didn't encounter during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through a more realistic example. Say we are given a training dataset of just 6 datapoints and want to train a model to then make predictions on a *different* set of points. We may be tempted to make a highly complex model (e.g., degree 5), especially given it makes perfect predictions on the training data as clear on the left. However, as shown in the graph on the right, this model would perform *horribly* on the rest of the population! \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/complex.png\" alt='complex' width='600'></center>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, since complex models are sensitive to the specific dataset used to train them, they have high **variance**. A model with high variance tends to *vary* more dramatically when trained on different datasets. Going back to our example above, we can see our degree-5 model varies erratically when we fit it to different samples of 6 points from `vehicles`. \n",

    "\n",
    "The takeaway here: we need to strike a balance in the complexity of our models; we want models that are generalizable to \"unseen\" data. A model that is too simple won't be able to capture the key relationships between our variables of interest; a model that is too complex runs the risk of overfitting. \n",
